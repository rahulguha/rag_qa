There was one amongst the Jin who was named Ivelis If I say the other name he's known by you recognize, Shaitan But the good Jin ever try interacting with us I don't know for a second But the evil Jin definitely do Do you think we live in a world where there are Jin's have taken the form of human beings And our public figures as well Yes, I would love for you to give context on the Quran It's the literal words of God in the Arabic time The Quran itself, Islam doesn't recognize itself as a religion in that sense It's a Dean or a way of life Do you think the flip side could be true as well Where your positive thoughts are coming from higher beings? This happens God can direct you in a guide you may have true dreams still exist And it's happened to many people I've had dreams, I'm sure you've had dreams Which you know a few weeks later or a few months later And it happens, you know And you're thinking I saw this in the drink Or I was made aware of this in the dreams So true dreams can happen is often The main issue of this sort of postmodern or meta-modern Society is that they don't believe in any of this And someone said that one of the greatest achievements of Satan Is him being able to convince people that he doesn't exist Because once he gets you to believe he doesn't exist He has full control over him Right? Once you recognize him you become aware of him And the way he functions, then you you're in good stead base Often if a person is supposedly possessed In India, one of the key things to do Is to take that person to a diagram There is these traditions of going to these peers Sometimes calling him to peer above us And forcing him, let's be honest Most of these guys are fruits Really, yeah You briefly mentioned Alistair Crowley What is said about Alistair Crowley? He's probably the most famous occultist Like I said of the 20th century And apparently he made contact with one of these beings Call of love Do you look at that being And you look at the modern grey alien It's almost identical I'm just going to be very transparent with you right now There's something in this room And I can like kind of almost feel it blocking off some of my questions I'm not surprised but these things They don't want to be spoken about Yeah This conversation is an attempt to learn about two chapters Of the human reality very deeply The first chapter is the world of the Jin It's an occult oriented chapter of the human reality It's a paranormal chapter of the human reality The other chapter that we've tried to uncover over the course of the conversation Is about the teachings of the Holy Quran It's about the teachings of Islam And both these chapters are deeply linked But you need a Quranic scholar to teach you about both these subjects It's been the on of my life to meet I'm not saying by All I want to say is that yes this conversation Gets a little scary It has that horror element But you need to know that the divine God Allah is with you through the conversation You learn a lot through the course of the next hour and a half Because of the immaculate I'm Rana Sain I'm Rana Sainh by Welcome to the Renvi show Thank you Renvi, pleasure man, honestly Check out some of your stuff like I said before Doing this as we you did I'm sure is all we all do And I was very impressed I've got to say you know I wanted to commend you I guess first and foremost Because you know having such a big platform And taking such a balanced stance And an honest stance with certain topics I think is commendable definitely Especially with Islam I saw you speaking about Islam on certain What cost and just having the courage to Call things out I really commend you for that no condemn you commend you commend you for that Thank you. Thank you brother Honestly, it's an attempt to understand life more deeply and to a large degree I think that this is what our ancestors did But those middle generations forgot about this stuff And this is similar to what we were speaking about right before we began rolling right now That I think the world is waking up To religion for sure spirituality for sure But the occur it as well But to the possibility of Subjects beyond traditional human understanding I found your profile so fascinating bro You're the right person to teach me and therefore all of us About certain aspects of Islam But at the same time You also have a deep interest in The UFO phenomenon that we're seeing is rising on the internet lately I couldn't have thought of a better guest for the topic of gins But also bit from modern lens So thank you for being on the show It's my pleasure honestly I'm honestly bursting with like questions right now Let's go ahead minus getting to it We had an actor called Jave Jave Jave on the show a few years ago And he was the first person who mentioned gins on the show And since then it's been one of those topics That's been in my heart in terms of something I wish to talk about on an episode This is that episode So I would love to know right from the basics In terms of the Quran What is said about gins And what are they? Imagine someone's hearing that word for the first time Yeah so etymologically the word itself The root of it goes through it refers to something in the Arabic to something that's hidden Or that's not seen So it's a part of the hidden realm the unseen realm Now obviously if you look at this what we're discussing right now from the perspective of modernity Or a secular perspective The unseen world doesn't exist Right it's all the scene the physical the material But I think people have grown beyond this now So these topics are very interesting to people So from an Islamic perspective this is referring to the unseen It's a part of the auntie so the jinn Our beings within Islam that are creation of God got created them God created them before he created the human beings us humans And they occupied the world So the jinn have been there they were created before us They were created from a different substance than us So in the Quran now we see some of these things need to be interpreted God refers to the humans as being created from clay like substance The angels were created from light Now the angels are also these you know non physical you can say supernatural beings Farishteh First thing that they all in Hindi that's the word that will be used to angels of God basically In Arabic what's it called? Angels Malayka Malayka Malayka Yeah Malayka They are the Arabic word itself so they're the angels Now the angels don't have free will They are completely obedient to God They obey the commands of God Then God also created the jinn Right now the jinn were created in the Quran it refers to as From a type of smokeless fire That's used in the Arabic Now this many have interpreted in different ways But it's a it's a different substance if you look at it from a sort of modern Scientific perspective some speculated that this may be referring to plasma for example the fourth state of matter I inclined towards the understanding but again speculation at the end of the day So they're created from the smokeless fire and humans will create from a clay like substance from the earth essentially So as humans we have the physical selves the be the this material body And then there's a soul within the human being as God says he created our souls and instilled the souls within this physical body But the jinns they were created from this smokeless type of fire they were created They were occupied the earth But they started to create a lot of corruption and bloodshed and drama and fa\u00e7ade and so on There was one amongst the jinn who was named oblise in the Quran we hear of him This figure. I don't know if you've heard of him before So oblise most people if I say the other name is known by you'll recognize it Shaytan Gotcha in English Satan But his original name wasn't Shaytan His original name was oblise He was a jinn But he was a jinn that he started to worship God and became a devout obedient worshiper of God and by the way The jinn just like humans have free will So they were created with free will is all like us So he would worship God and he rose in rank because he would worship God and he became very obedient to God To the degree where he got to the level of the angels so he'd worship God amongst the angels And then God decided to create in San in the Arabic which is the human right which is us human beings So God created Adam or Adam as he's not right the first human being now again the narrative I'm just stringing all the different sources for example Enjoying just being in your presence. Okay, so so I'm gonna string all the sources together because one when I refer to these things There's a there's different sources on referencing so the Quran the Hadi's literature The Tafasir or the exegesis of the Quranic etc But I'm bringing you all together to paint this sort of cohesive image for us. That's easy to understand So God creates Adam his physical being and The narrative tell us that Shaytan would oblise at the time so that God created this being and started to become jealous Right, he didn't like this being he would travel through the body of Adam and realize he was hollow Internally empty meaning to physical being of Adam And then God at one point decided to breathe the soul that got created into the human being Right, which brought Adam to life Now when he was brought to life the Quranic narrative when we read the second chapter of the Quran God tells us that he taught Adam the names of all things Now what these things are against scholars have given a lot of thought to this and exegesis on this Some say is the name of all created things So or some say it was knowledge that God gave Adam which made Adam superior to all these other beings So God taught in the names of things and when God announced to the angels that he's creating this being the angels God records them as saying in the Quran he they asked God are you gonna create a being that's gonna cause corruption and bloodshed on the earth Now the scholars ask well, why did the Angels assume this and some say it was because they saw what the general were doing on the earth The corruption in the bloodshed so they assumed that these beings this new being also with free will is gonna do the same thing Right because when you have free will you can choose to do good you can choose to do bad Right if you go down the bad room This is gonna be bloodshed and corruption And this is evident from our own history the history of the world So the angels are often God says I know what you do not know to the angels So then God teaches Adam the names of things then he brings Adam in front of the angels And he says tell them the names of all these things Adam does this he displays this ability God has given him and then God asks the angels including Ibalis is in that gathering now this gin To bow down into frustration in front of Adam Now this frustration was out of respect No out of worship because in Islam the concept of thohid or wonders of God is very clear That the human being was created to worship God alone Not to bow down to anything or anyone else just worship God the one that made you directly So God tells the angels to bow down to Adam out of respect all of the angels immediately bow down Because they obey the commands of God but oblis doesn't he refuses And then God asks him he says well why didn't you bow down to Adam And he said I am better than him And then he reasons with God so you can say he was a first of pseudo rationalist in history Who argued with God right and he said no I am better than him I am made of fire He is made of clay so this was his rationalization But God is all knowing and what oblis didn't understand that God has done this wisdom behind why God Created this being a why he asked but his arrogance and his jealousy prevented him from bang down to Adam and This now sets the soul scene the historical scene for this battle between good and evil that we find in history That oblis is not not going to bow down to him and then God says to him You know admonishes him but he says God ask God to give him time till the day of judgment So God answers this request. He says fine. You got time till the day of judgment And he says I will try to mislead this being that you've created I will try to affect him and take him off the straight path Right so this animosity and this hatred this dynamic the scene is set now So Shaythan he became Shaythan at this point Shaythan is the evil one the accursed one that's what the word means in Arabic the one that's cursed by God So his objective was said he his objective now to the day of judgment was to misguided human beings and affect human beings This is the sort of foundation of the story right the dynamic dynamic between man and gin Right now if you look at the Quran the jenna mentioned constantly throughout the Quran really yeah throughout the Quran So in the second chapter of the Quran most of the story that I've mentioned to you is there Then you have Surajin which is a specific chapter of the Quran named after the jin is called You know the Surah or the chapter Chapter is in the right word for Surah Surah is like a is a part of the Quran But you can say chapter in English that's called the jin But okay, so bro. I understood the origin stories of Shaythan uh Am I supposed to look at Shaythan as the leader of the jin? You can say that yes, okay, so he was Maybe not the first but you can say is the leader of the jin the evil jin especially Because Shaythan is the evil amongst the jin now amongst the jin They're a good jin and they are evil jin just like amongst humans They're good humans and they're evil humans So that's why the Quran is what's interesting the word Shaythan is used for humans and for the jin sometimes Right, so it's not exclusive for the jin And many people have this misconception but in the Quran He got refers to some humans as Shaythan and some jin as Shaythan is well Got you um, yeah, I mean I've read about the topic of Shaythan. I've read about the topic of Shaythan and please correct me or disagree with me because I think it leads to Richard conversation What I've understood is that now if you're living your own human life You're going about life making your own decisions But your your own mind creates bad possibilities Hey, I'm feeling anger towards this situation of person I'm feeling greed. I'm feeling lust That pull in the negative direction towards these Emotions is created by Shaythan or Shaythan which is also present inside us Fair to say I think you're spot on yeah, right? So there's a dynamic that's going on there Which is that the human mind you know, yes, we have many thoughts throughout the day some are good some are bad But what Shaythan does is something called waswasa in Arabic The term is waswasa which is basically whispering He whispers to you like you mentioned So he may incline you towards those negative aspects of your personality and your psychology And get you to focus on those things and encourage you to engage in those thoughts more And even act out on those things But we learn from Islam that there is a system the evil gen follow which is the working gradual steps So they'll gradually encourage you first they may get you to think about certain things And the more you think about these things the more they build in your mind and the more you focus on them And sometimes this is the way he affects human beings, right? So if you look at for example some psychological issues some people may have you know The metaphysical dimension of it from a religious perspective Maybe you know that Shaythan is encouraging the person to fixate on certain negative things Which then troubles the person and then causes these issues You know physiologically within the person such as adrenaline and which cause anxiety and all of this type of stuff Right so there's definitely that metaphysical dimension that's taking place But waswasa is there so he will whisper to you negative thoughts and agitate you and bother you and get you to Focus on negative things and do bad things etc Got it. I've had countless spiritualists on the show who've constantly mentioned the possibility that Human beings are arrogant enough to think that all of their thoughts are their own But your thoughts are affected by some external forces which you're not in control of and a very practical version of this possibility is when you enter Certain geographies or certain spaces sometimes you just feel like what we call a bad vibe But it could be that there are external things which you cannot see which are affecting the way of thinking 100% yeah in Islam. We also recognize that there is you can say the spiritual sense So when we pray sola which is the prayer the five daily prayers It's a connection with God You know you're engaging with God when you because you're reciting the Quran in your prayers So God is speaking to you and then you are making prayer within the in the sola itself Which is you speaking to God? So it's a dynamic between you and God a relationship between you and God That's why sola the English word prayer is in the correct translation because prayer is supplication But sola is a connection with God so that's not happening, you know through physical means It's there's a spiritual connection. So yes You get a vibe sometimes you go somewhere and you feel something is off It's like you're tuning your radio set to get into that. It's like a spiritual sense So there's the five senses and then you've got the if you like the sixth sense Which is the spiritual sense which is the spiritual heart or the soul which you know connects Now you said that you can understand Shaitan to be the leader of the badgins We also spoke a little bit about finding bad vibes in certain places Could be a possibility that those certain places are occupied by bad genes that we cannot see yes Do you know AR Ramanas? Music I've heard the name okay. He's a legendary music composer from India I had a conversation about sufism with him a long time ago And he said that there's 36,000 filters between yourself and the ultimate reality And as you keep spiritually progressing a few of those little filters are lifted up And every single occultist that I've had on the show says something similar As you keep building your intuition you are able to see things that you weren't able to see earlier On a very basic level it begins by Just being a better observer Picking up a vibe from a human being becoming more intuitive about situations Of course on higher levels of that same journey You are able to see things around you That's how I understand the concept of genes as well They are for lack of better words higher or lower beings I'd probably put the bad genes as lower beings and the good genes as higher beings We spoke it ferricity sometime ago Malika. Yes, I put them as higher beings as well And for me this is one of the most fascinating aspects of Islam Like from the outside because I'm still learning about it through the show But this is the one that caught my maybe out of natural interest for the Auckland Please correct me Ad to what I know Many people have like I know I have friends for example, I have a friend who's a white river to Islam and The reason he looked into Islam was because of his experience with Jin So he could use to go to Africa travel a lot and he used to have here some experiences with black magic there And voodoo and stuff like this And then when he came across the concept of Jin and he read the Quran He's like well, I've seen this stuff. I know this stuff You know and that brought him to Islam That was his journey and many people are interested in this topic You know and like I said the Quran God himself speaks about the Jin throughout the Quran You know if it wasn't important God wouldn't speak about them Right and I've one of the reasons is because like we saw in the story Shaitan is you're now now You're number one enemy You know to take you off the straight path so life according to just to so again This is another element which will build out the picture What is the life in this world about? You know existentially from an Islamic perspective God tells us that he created life and death to test which of us is best indeed in action Right so this is a testing ground this life. It's not supposed to be paradise. We hate to be tested Are we gonna use all the faculties God has given us our hearts our minds to do what's right Stand up for the truth and do good things or are we gonna do what's evil and bad? That's the test right and one of the fundamental aspects of the test is Can the human being with all the faculties God has given him recognizes creator? Right because that's fundamental God also says in the Quran that he created the human beings and the Jin kind Omar Kharagthul-Jinah will insert El-El-Liabudu in the Arabic ayah in the Quran diverse I did not create the Jin kind or the human beings except to know me into worship Right and worship in Islam is not just praying to God It's literally your whole living conscious existence. How you act what you do are you a good person You know that is all worship if you do it with the right consciousness in the right the right right mindset So the Jin are constantly mentioned and also the God mentions that they are also your enemy the bad Jin the evil Jin They are your enemy because they will constantly try to misguided you that's what Shaitan said you will try to misguided you and being through the straight path So God warns us about them and gives us a lot more information about them I mean we know so there's so much mention about these beings we call the Jin And what's also interesting by the way and I'm sure you looked into this is if you look at world religions And I studied this quite a bit for my the first few years of my masters Is that you see that if you any culture Any place anytime throughout history whether you look at the Irish law whether you look at Native Indian law whether you look at African religions Every cultural religion has mentioned beings That are not God and are not human but there's somewhere in between the occupy a realm in between And when you study those beings what you see is that there's clear correlations between them The sources are talking about the same entity Right but that manifests in different ways and what's also very interesting about Jin Is what they capable of doing and I think this explains a lot of things in the world So for example the Jin have an ability which is that they can take on different forms Right the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon and mentioned in one narration that the Jinines of three kinds And they're not limited to these three kinds but these are three main kinds Those that fly through the sky Those that appear in the form of dogs and snakes and those that come and go Right and that's very interesting. We also know again we can get into this when maybe later on That there are certain examples or Nourations in the Islamic tradition which highlight that the Jin could take on the form of human beings The Jin can take on the form of different animals and different beings And it's when they take on these forms is when we can see them But in their natural forms we normally cannot see them And this is very interesting because this if you look at understand conceptually what the Jin are capable of Like they can take on different forms in manifest in different ways This actually explains a lot of the paranormal You know and this even explains a lot of the sort of modern day UFO phenomenon as well That we're currently witnessing it as becoming a trend Joe Rogan and all these big guys are Podcasts are speaking about these days So I mean it's very interesting this topic I mean it goes in so many different directions and it's also linked to the occult you study occult history Maybe we can get into this as well You'll see that the link with the Jin they may not call them the Jin some do some have different names for them But there's always a link there with the Jin Okay, one statement and one question The statement is that I'm loving speaking with you man. I'm loving listening to you I'm enjoying this too man. You're very relaxed and you know I can see how much you're into the topic. Yeah, which gets me excited because I love talking about this too Um The question what did you study for your masters? So Islamic studies Okay, but it was there the rule I took was it was most of generalized Islamic studies along with other religions and Islamic philosophy and things like this nice. Yeah, and then my personal work experience as well I actually gained much of my knowledge through my work experience because my work allowed me to I really didn't study a law in an auto-dactives and active sense By myself as opposed to academically that academia went into late around again back to academia Give us some context when you were so I work for an organization called Sapiens Institute They've solved our objectives is to share Islamic telektually Removing the misconceptions and a lot of there's a lot of nonsense out there Normally Islam with other religions involved these days You know when you see when politics and religion and other objectives get mixed in Religion takes the brunt of it most of the time unfortunately But you know our objective is how can share Islamic telektually with people remove the misconceptions So they can understand what Islam actually is and what it actually teaches As opposed to these misconceptions and people being misinformed by these things out Been waiting for you for a very long time I mean if you look at religious process, God decreased these things I mean I didn't plan this you didn't plan it just in a way happen a mutual Contact that we had you know we knew and it just you know sprung from that So interesting how things work in this world, you know who writes the script man, you know It's very interesting For my podcast. I mean there's always been a bit of a spiritual bent We hadn't scheduled this is the first time we ever meet each other I saw you for the first time a couple of days ago. Thanks to Afghanistan I think I love that name of that you buy we're gonna use that from now on I'm not gonna say his other name to me for a time just in case he doesn't want people to know but I've gone anybody is good, but um You know before I took off for The UK I Did a I prayed and I just said that he sent me the right people For these candidates. This is what I want to explore. I want to take this content out for the world I know that this particular episode is gonna get a lot of views But that's a bonus the real benefit is just meeting you for the first time. Oh, likewise Honestly the time I feel the most alive is when I'm talking about topics like this Because yes, it has some dark elements But I feel that when the human mind understands darkness you also move closer to the light. Yeah, and that's that's what makes us superior It's the intellect that God's blessed us with right In the Islamic understanding One of the things that distinguishes the human from the jinn is this intellectual capacity that we have Physically we may not be as powerful as the jinn because again We can go there's so much to talk about you know About what the had the strength of the jinn or the power of the jinn the abilities of the jinn We can't do many of those things as human beings But one of the things that sets us apart and elevates us is our intellectual ability You know, so although we may talk about these dark topics as long as you have knowledge and clarity You can safeguard yourself, you know, you're good. You're in a good place But yeah, I mean so you think this ability to go about analytical thought is what separates human kind from the jinn One of the things it's not to say jinns can't think but we saw from the story of obliques Logically if we think about this he reasoned with God his reasoning was flawed But nevertheless he did reason with God so they do have the ability to reason But maybe not to the degree that the human beings can attain or get to the truth through thought and reflection and what we make Will philosophy today or just deep introspection. Hmm. Okay. You said that the jinner mentioned throughout the Holy Quran How come so yeah, one of the things I think like so in again in Islam The Quran we believe his revelation from Allah from God right yeah, let's take a step back. Yeah I don't know how you're going to do this But I would love for you to give context on the Quran because most people know what the Quran is I'm talking about non-Muslims. Yeah But don't know the contents of it. So is it a story? What we believe is the Quran we believe is revelation from God and it's the words of God So which were communicated through the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him over 1400 years ago in the Arabian desert In Mecca right and then he moved to Medina later on O Yathrebe as it was known and then he then he became known as Medina when he moved there So the Quran is revelation from God. It's the literal words of God in the Arabic language Right that was then communicated through the Prophet to humanity to people What is the Quran if you study the Quran from cover to cover? It doesn't read it doesn't follow you what some would call Aristotelian logic. What I mean by that is in the West we have Text which are beginning middle and end right so that's a normal textbook read if you read a storybook has a beginning middle and end If you even read a scientific textbook. It has some sort of structure beginning middle and end The Arabic structure of Semitic language is generally they have a different structure Right, so it's not beginning middle and end so when you read the Quran you'll see The Quran will speak about one topic and then it will jump to a different topic and then it'll come back to the same topic And then it'll give you a different shade of the third topic or the second topic that I mentioned in a different way So go from one topic to a different and sometimes it will be first person narrative of God is speaking to you directly And then God will go into a story which then reflect some of the lessons that God has just mentioned through that story So the Quran is structured in a very different way. That's why when people read the Quran in English When they used to reading normal books, right, it's very hard for them to engage in the beginning because it follows a totally different structure of Reading one understanding So yeah, the stories in the Quran there are Things that God says so laws in the Quran are mentioned There are certain Principles that I mentioned There's a lot of different things in the Quran, but if you take a holistic understanding of what the Quran is What the Quran says it is The Quran says what God says in the Quran that the Quran is guidance Who then in us guidance for humanity And who then little mottakin another word that's used guidance for people of takua people of consciousness of God or awareness of God So it's a book of guidance basically It's what we believe the Quran is the final revelation It's not a new religion now again from a secular political perspective What you see is that Islam as with other religions is presented as just a religion Right So that it's something you practice in your own behind closed doors and stuff like this But the Quran itself Islam doesn't recognize itself as a religion in that sense It's a dean or a way of life Right and what's also interesting beautiful about Islam for me at least is that God outlines that this is not for a specific group of people in a specific age This is for the whole of humanity everyone could benefit from it if they want to And it's not a new religion is from the same God that sent messengers and prophets throughout history Right so God sent different messengers the Quran mentions many many messengers God sent some by name some not by name But messengers were sent to different nations different people throughout history with the same fundamental message So the core message was always the same Recognize your creator Worship him live a good life because you're gonna be accountable on the day of judgment You're gonna face your creator after death Right so the core message was the same But the laws and rules were different according to different times and places So you'll see different those change over time But the fundamental message has always been very simple and the same Worship your creator live a good life. You're gonna return back to God. You'll be you're gonna be accountable So that's what the Quran is in a in a naturalist guidance for humanity It's a guidance for humanity, but is it also guidance for gins? Yes, it's an interesting you asked that question So you know there was times in the Prophet Muhammad's life face your point in Where the jin actually listened to the Quran So there was one occasion where he went to a place called Thife in Arabia I believe it's just as a Medina And he went and because his the Prophet's role is what the Prophet's role is like the hero's journey So this the prophetic figure Has Revelation that comes to him right he received revelation from God. There's a period where he's You know trying to figure things out and he's developing and learning and receiving this information And then he's given the mission of carrying this to humanity Right so the Prophet job the world the Prophet's job was to deliver this message to the people So the Prophet Muhammad on one occasion went to a place called Thife An area in Arabia to deliver this message, but the chiefs of that area They mocked him they beat him, you know They you told the kids to throw stones at him and get rid of him Basically and I mean there's narrations that tell us that the Prophet bled to the point where the blood Seeped down to his sandals and the sandals stuck to his feet right the blood between his feet and the sandals around the way back He was reciting the Quran And some of the jinn listened to the Quran Right and we know that the Quran mentions this that the jinn listened to the Quran and then they some of them accepted this message Right and they took it back to their communities and their people Right so we know that the Quran is for the jinn to Right Like I said in the verse we got says and he created the jinn kind and mankind for no other reason except to worship God So the objective is the same for the jinn and human beings which is to know God and to worship him But again amongst humans and the jinn there'll be those that don't and those that do So the Quran and other revelations I believe previous revelations were also for both humans and the jinn kind understood Okay I'm going to ask you to help me with some visualization you Because When an average person hears the word jinn if they know a little bit about it they automatically tie it to one of ghost Or demon yeah one of these two things yes What am I supposed to visualize when I'm thinking about a jinn? Yeah, so this is it's actually a brilliant question you asked because sometimes some Muslims struggle with this too This this thing because when you think about the word jinn Right, and this is not only for the subcontinent. This is the same anywhere in the West as well When you think about jinn you think of demons or you think of ghosts or you think of an evil being that possesses Sure jinn possessed people right Possession the possession for nomenan again is cross-cultural. You'll see in different cultures different communities etc But the general limited to these things Again, if you look at Hollywood they've character chilled the jinn You know you think of jinn you think of these blue genies that come out of a lamp right because of a loud and add it exactly Right, so you that is these visuals that come to your mind But the jinn are far more than this right so they're there are these beings for example Yeah, when it when in the Quran God speaks about the story of Solomon King Solomon Solomon Elayesna He was given a certain kingdom so Solomon made a prayer to God He asked God to give him a kingdom like no one else has had before and no one else would have And God gave him command over the jinn the winds you know the animals and so on so he get and and the jinn helped him build many things In the Quran God refers to the jinn as builders and divers And what divers Divers dive into the the oceans. Okay, so these are traits we're learning about the jinn the jinn build things Right, we know they build things for Solomon right the jinn can build things the jinn could dive into the oceans The jinn can also now Okay, let me just give you the story first. So when you read the story of Solomon in the Quran There's a place. I think it's in in chapter kosura namma Where the queen of shiba had the throne? Right, and a Solomon was also a prophet of God so again, prophet's objective is to guide human beings So he wanted to show the power of God to the queen of shiba So they were coming over to see King Solomon and he asked his jinn He asked his the beings he had power over the animals the jinn etc You know who could bring me her throne She had this amazing throne You know because he wanted to show the past when she came in she saw her throne she built how how in the world did this gay So one of the jinn who was known as a fleet so there are different classes of jinn He said I could bring this to you, you know before you stand up basically Right now if you think about this is like thousands of miles away You know and another one, you know who had knowledge of the book You know some say it was a jinn some say it wasn't it was just another being but The jinn have this ability you can say in modern language to teleport things or materialize and dematerialize things Someone said the dimensional beings Right, so they exist in a different plane of reality And they come in and out of our plane because the Quran does says they see you from where you do not see them There is a verse in the Quran So maybe this is a different dimension talking in today's language. That's the plane possibly a different You know dimension of a different frequency So these are all possibilities if you look at Arab history just general Arab law Of the Arabs You see that they have it's littered with stories of jinn Right, so the Arabs even before Islam when they were going to the desert They would seek refuge with the leaders of the jinn in the desert So they went troubled by a other jinn Many of the Arabs worship these jinn because they will see them as these deities Some of the you know these jinn they would they would take on forms of superior beings They would appear to people and then people worship those beings again Shaitan's objective of taking people away from the worship of God You know and getting them to focus on other things and other other beings So you see they can do all of these things They can give us was for sound like we mentioned earlier They can whisper to you You know and that seems to be the main way that the share thing the jinn the evil jinn affect human beings It's through these whispers and normally they're done in your own voice in your head So you feel like it's coming from you your thoughts But sometimes this disguised in your own voice, but it's coming from share thing You know one of the ways to recognize this is is it a negative thought Is it something that bothers you and irritates you and agitates you and creates anxiety within you? You know and then we told this you know in the Quran that if you get something like this you seek refuge with God Right because you know we say the battle between good and evil, but the god is the all powerful being You know the share thing they have no power over God You know there's no comparison in any way shape or form So you seek refuge with God and that's you know that's that's the way of protecting yourself Do you think the flip side could be true as well where your positive thoughts also coming from higher beings? They so they could be a case of maybe inspiration Right, it's not why he in Arabic which is A revelation so we believe the revelation stopped with the Prophet peace people and use the final messages in the line of prophets Right and maybe because we need the end of history right so there's gonna be a time with the chain of profiled stops at some point Right just matter it's happened stop with the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him But you still could get inspiration You know and this happens, you know God can direct you and guide you and give you this of intuitive inspiration Sometimes about something you may have dreams true dreams still exist And it's happened to many people I've had dreams. I'm sure you've had dreams which You know a few weeks later or a few months later and it happens, you know And you're thinking I saw this in a dream or I was made aware of this in a dream so true dreams can happen as well Yeah, so inspiration can come in different ways So there are these forces positive and negative acting upon the human plane You know and I think that the the the main issue of This sort of postmodern or meta modern societies that they don't believe in any of this anymore So you know Someone said that one of the greatest achievements of of Satan is Him being able to convince people that he doesn't exist That's as big as achievement because once he gets you to believe he doesn't exist here as full control over you Right once you recognize him you become aware of him and the way he functions Then then you you're in good stead basically Is there any Reference or description of a jinn's face So there are some references in regards to their parents in the original form So for example, there's narrations that may refer to the fact that the jinn or the sheathine have horns Right, so you know these depictions of horned beings is evil demonic beings They're not too far off in some ways, but they they've vials of at least the evil amongst them in the original form They're very sort of not pleasant to look at But again as human beings we can't see them in the original form in most cases They may take on a disturbing form sometimes Very evil scary form, but then again that may just be a form. They've taken on not the original form From an Islamic perspective as far as I'm aware there is no clear description of what the sheathine look like in its original form But we may we have some references, you know about its horns etc But they can take on very despicable nasty forms as well to scare people and to terrorize people as well Because law beings feel unfair Yeah, fear is a big thing man. Yeah fear is I would say one of his number with the sheathines number one tools Because once he has you afraid because look fear. What does it do? It paralyzes you? It sucks your energy I love this aspect of global For lack of better words religion Where every single world culture has some kind of an occult element Similar to what you said. Yes every single world culture talks about higher beings or other worldly beings other dimensions and Then there's an element about how you as a human being can either interact with those dimensions or Reach out to them or reach them completely I don't know what the globally equivalent of this word is But I've had friends Who have you know what? There goes you see a place where people go and pray it's it's a shrine shrines Yes, it's it's actually a very subcontinent little thing. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think it exists in the Gulf As much no as much no. Yeah, but often if a person is supposedly possessed In India one of the key things to do is to take that person to a darga. Yes Now at the darga they end up working with I don't know the right word with priests Of some sort of leaders in the lead place here religious leaders were Fakir yeah, suppose it religiously is that what you don't refer to them as people that in charge of the place I guess and have some abilities apparently that can Exercise I want to talk about those leaders and how they get those abilities. Yeah, and this aspect of them Having for lack of better words pet gyms themselves. Yeah, who helped them out with their work. Yeah, yeah And parallel I also want to talk about oracles from like ancient Greece and Rome. Yeah, who were able to talk about like the future Yes, yes, I wouldn't be surprised if they also had higher beings with them. Yeah, you may I could see you've made the links Yeah, and I think you're spot on 100% let's let's talk about this Spiritual leader thing because I know that pardon me. We were using these words pro but we had someone called Peter Gray on the show Few days ago. He spoke about Magic within the subcontinent is called Jadu. Yes. I don't know if it's the same word in Arabic I don't know the myrrh because in that good. So I don't know what magician was called It's called Sarah is what people do upon someone But there is this occult element of Islam as well. Well, yeah, so this okay, so let's a couple of things because we need to unpack this Take a take your time. Yeah, because I want to adjust this because I think there's a lot to say here But you got the what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, go for it. So okay, so from an from an Islamic perspective It's always not not encouraged to engage with these beings Right, and the good jinn would not interact with human beings anyway Because the good jinn meaning those that worship God and they've good lives They have their own communities. They do their own things. There's no reason to interact It's only the evil amongst the jinn that would Engage in the human role and normally they won't engage for no reason. There's a reason behind it Sometimes it happens through a medium or a magician Right some of the engages in the magic right and we're gonna get to that Sometimes it may not happen because of that reason sometimes the jinn could just fall in love Or become attracted to a human being the evil jinn and then they become attached to that person Right sometimes the human being may harm a jinn unintentionally So for example where they where they may live over the places they may occupy You know someone may go there and do something vile or urinate or you know or maybe T harm them in some way or the other and that could cause a retaliation From the jinn right so these are few ways that these dimensions of these realms our realm and they remain interact But a lot of the time it's through Embedition or a medium or someone that's engaging with these beings Sometimes it's a part of your faith you're being tested. Are you gonna be patient and rely upon God? If you for example dealing with the possession We know that in Islam the Quran itself is chiffa which is healing So you'll see some Iraqis or people that will rookia in Arabic which is basically They're this like the Islamic version of exorcism which is that they recite Quran upon someone that's possessed And it removes jinn over time because the Quran to harmful jinn evil jinn it burns them it destroys them So it's a means of exercising But even in Islam it's encouraged to not seek out rookia as a higher level of spirituality Again that direct connection with God seeking from God alone not from anything where anyone else is that direct connection with your creator So It's just generally I'm the first point I'm trying to get across is that Islamically it's not encouraged to go to these people And it does not need for it if you know who God is and you have a strong relationship with God however Practically pragmatically in society Especially in the subcontinent. There is these traditions of going to these beards sometimes called them You know build bubbles and and unfortunately let's be honest there most of them these guys are frauds Some do engage with the jinn so they go have do certain practices and by the way, bro I'm sure you've looked into this for someone to take get control of the jinn or to have him as a pet like you said animism. Yeah, it takes a lot of Sacrifice and degradation of the human self To achieve that because the jinn don't work for free. What's most people not realize is these evil jinn They're not gonna help you for no reason Right they're gonna they want something back in return and what they want is always more than you ask from them And in many cases these jinn Require and ask people to do some despicable things, bro. I mean, I'll give you an exam just as a side point Have you heard of jackpottons? Name rings, yeah, okay, so jackpottons was a direct student of Alice to Crowley. Alice to Crowley, you know I'm sure you've heard he's you go to any talk about your cult Alice to Crowley's day he was one of the biggest occultists of the past, you know 20th century you can say Did some evil despicable things. I mean if you look at the stuff he did it's just shocking right Jack Parsons was one of his main students now jackpottons was he's also known if you're searching up from Google He is one of the founding fathers of modern day rocketry so NASA all of these big organizations this space organization the Bill shuttles and stuff Jack Parsons was one of the founders of modern rocketry and what he would do He was Alice to Crowley is one of his main students and he would go out into the desert and conduct rituals You know and ask help from these beings You know to give him knowledge basically and stuff so you conduct these rituals before launch is You know I'm not gonna mention it because I think is he there was there was Stuff he did with pets animals in his own family, you know sexual stuff which is abhorrent with his own mother It's all day. I mean people can go look this up. This is not conspiracies all day You can see you can read this off yourself So you see is that these people when they engage with these beings or try to control them or get benefit from them They have to do some disgusting things things which go against pure spirituality, you know and and and purity and and goodness just evil despicable things You see this amongst many of the thinkers of the West as well Those guys that were pushing on the on the public end they were pushing you know modernity and rationalism and empiricism and you know progress and you know in materialism But on the back end they went to alchemy and they went to all of this type of you know engaging with these beings The Greeks even brought they call them day ones Right and you see they were trying to make contact with these beings these astral beings or beings from a different plane And a lot of these guys so aside from the frauds that out there amongst people who these beings Right though They are some that engage with these beings and they may say oh look, you know this because you know There's two in the subcontinent. There's this distinction between black and white magic Gala Jardhou and you know white magic. I don't know what they may call it in in order to Hindi But it's essentially I mean anyone that says that they have a good being that's going to help them Overcome this it should raise a question mark Right because to get control of This supposed it good being one good gin won't come into contact with humans anyway Because they're good and they know their limits and they stay to their own realm So and also the gin gin in Islam. We know the deceptive they lie they deceive Right Again another tangy song we should talk about this topic but another tangy We know that before the advent of Islam The gin one of the things they would do because the abilities they had was they were traveling to the heavens And they would take bits of information because remember we're in serial time Right, so we were past present future. We can't jump from now to the future Right or you know, so we're going through this linear serial time The gin would go out of this realm or dimension in modern terms And they will try access knowledge from the other realms from the realms of the angels heavens And they'll bring some of this knowledge of the future back and give it to these people Who would then go to the disciples and say look, you know This is gonna happen and this is gonna happen the the oracles and stuff right But with the advent of the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him They were banned from doing this they couldn't go into the heavens anymore and extract information So they had this this other abilities were back in the day So they and hence they would inform these oracles and then the oracles would you know inform people of Even there was certain Sufi so for example in the time of Ibn Thaymiah An Islamic scholar He has a very interesting quote the the essays on the gin Phenomenal book is an English translation as well some of the stories in their mind blowing right He mentions that there were Sufi's at the time certain Sufi masters Who would be in contact with these gin and to get in contact with them They were probably doing some crazy stuff anyway, which was an Islamic right or unethical or unspiritual And these beings would you know help them So you know if they're disciples were in trouble somewhere these gins will take on the form of the Sufi Massner appear to the disciples in another place one of these apparently Sufi masters said that when I die I would come and bury myself Essentially was the gin that took on the form of him and then buried it to show these miracles to the disciples and mislead them So there's been many people like this within the Islamic tradition as well Islamic history who have Wanted to engage with these beings and take control of them But it's always a very dark thing I mean anyone that says to me look You know, I have I'm in contact with these beings and it's all good and it's pure I would always always a question mark It's just because the nature of these beings and the fact that the good amongst them won't be engaging with us anyway So whatever you're in contact with how do you know it's not deceiving you and telling you it's a good Right it's a possibility. There's a deceptive nature that these beings have So you never know with it and that's why it's always encouraged to stay away from this room Hopefully the answer is a question. I know I've gone on to make thank you. That's my bro You answered every aspect. Okay, perfect You briefly mentioned Alistair Crowley. Yeah. What is what is said about Alistair Crowley? He was an occultist He's probably the most famous occultist like is it of the 20th century and he won of his objectives Male objectives was to make contact with one of these beings from these other planes He was very wealthy and rich right his father was Christian. He despised Christianity Right and he was engaged in all of these occult practices and rituals And apparently he made contact with one of these beings called lamb lamb lamb. Yeah, if he searched lamb you see this This depiction of a being that he painted right And it's very interesting you look at that being and you look at the modern gray alien in modern UFO law It's almost identical It's almost they look the same right But yeah, so he was trying to make contact with these beings and again engaging with all these sex rituals and all of this dark stuff And apparently he made a lot of progress in his occult practices But yet to do a lot of disgusting stuff and he encouraged a lot of other people to get involved in this Like jack past and etc. Why do you think the gins want someone to go about? Disgusting acts in return for whatever they're doing for the human being I think was so Considering the the history which we discussed in the beginning that she thought wants to miss guide human beings Right, so in any way if you can take the human being away from God and purity towards evil and Worshiping other things. He's happy Right, he's made his objective, right? Because he is destined for the hell fire Right because he dissipate, you know, he argued with God He refused to bow down to Adam. He said he's gonna mislead human beings. He's the evil character Now his objective is to take people to hell with him Like humans. There's this being that God is so proud of that God created You know, he wants to almost prove a point Now I am I am better than him as he said and I would he was just take them to hell with him first of all I'm just going to be very transparent with you right now Uh Okay, and I also feel really safe with you guys you're safe man. Yeah If anybody's not gonna know how many of us but there's something in this room And I can like kind of almost feel it blocking off some of my questions So but anyway, I'm just gonna carry on. Yeah Um Yeah, and I'm not surprised but these things they don't want they don't want to be spoken about. Yeah My head is hurting like crazy and I know When that happens does it happens in these kind of episodes You believe in God, right? I assume of course of course Secret refugees got that yeah, because these beings have no power over God man They're they're a creation of God. Yeah, you know, so like I said this whole good versus evil that you see in some cultures That the evil is as powerful as the good It's not true. If God is the creator whatever background you come from if you believe God is the creator He's the all powerful creator that created everything and has control of everything these beings are within the creation of God They're not superior to God. So God seeking refuge with God these beings can't do anything You know right before we began rolling We were talking about how when you engage with these topics you invite these topics into your reality Right. Yeah, why do they not want to be spoken about? because this is I mean, you know, it's Forchetan one of his biggest assets Well the things that works for him is that when people don't know about him and the way he functions the functions in the way he works That's where he can function the best In in disguise behind the curtains, you know, so it's they don't like this What is a year that course? I told course he is a verse for the Quran which is a protecting verse So we're told to recite it right because it protects you against evil forces So Muslims are encouraged to recite it for example before they go to sleep And night because it protects you from the evil beings that may come to you and night in your dreams etc because one of the ways they try to affect you through when you're in dream room Bro because the mind you know something happens during sleep against sleep is one of those puzzles of modern sciences Well, you know how it really works But there's a metaphysical dimension to it You know, we go somewhere out. So our mind our consciousness our souls, you know into a different realm And these beings tend to affect people in sleep a lot as well So I told course he's a protection the interesting story by it will cross the You know in Islam the who you know who informed us about the idol course he being a protection against shaitan He was the shaitan himself One thing they spoke the truth about so the story basically goes during the time of the prophet peace be upon him one of the companions He was put in charge of the charity at the Betel mal the place of charity because people give charity or be in a place If anyone needed they can come and take from the charity So I think it was it was it was the charity that was he was guarding something precious Think he was the charity and one night this guy this man comes and he steals from the charity and the companion of the prophet Cool catches him and says what you're stealing. I'm gonna take you to the prophet You know, he says no, let me go. He makes up and excuse my family's poor etc Next night comes back does the same thing and I think he does this consecutively two or three nights in a row And on the third or fourth occasion this companion of the prophet Caches him he says I'm taking you to the prophet this time. I mean enough is enough. He keeps stealing right He says no, no, let me go. I'll tell you something of benefit. Just let me go Right, and he says if you recite idol course he will protect you against the shaitan Right, so the next he let them go Next morning the companion goes to the prophet He says this man kept doing this and he told me this and the prophet informs him that the man that came to you Was the shaitan He was an evil jinn in the form of a man And what he said in this instance was true that the idol course he does protect you against shaitan So that's some of the history behind idol course itself, but it's a protecting verse You know you spoke about how this evil jinn took the form of a man Do you think we live in a world where there are jinns of taking the form of human beings? Yes, and a public figure as well public figures I don't know if you have someone specific in mind to put I mean, I'm thinking of a few people Okay, they may they for a definite they probably if they evil Conquo They may be the shear thin amongst the human the evil amongst the human But I don't know public figures, but from at least the Islamic side of stuff Yes, the jinn can take on the form of men So their narration is one of the narrations of jishid with you That they can't take on for the form of people as well as animals and so on now if a jinn appears in the form of a man You're gonna assume he's human right There may be some telltale signs etc now again the the the how of it we don't have much details of how does this being that's made of smokeless fire Matt or shape shift or take on the form of his physical being when he takes on this physical shape or form Is he now susceptible to the things that physical beings are susceptible to these are big questions, right? So for example, there is a narration where a jinn that appeared in the form of a snake One of the companions killed the snake But the snake also killed the companion But the point was that he died in the form of when he was in the form of that physical snake Right so this narration tells us that It's a possibility that when the jinn are in physical form Whatever form that is that they can this susceptible to things that are the physical beings are susceptible to Like human beings such as death Right so is again this whole speculation, right? But why would they take the form of something physical? Again to mislead like for example human affairs. Yeah, affect human affairs. So there's many this a very interesting book by Sheikh Omar Al Ashkar It's called the world of the the jinn and demons Very interesting book is in English as well And he mentions that they could take on many forms It seems like the preferred form the easiest form to affect humans is just through waswasa whispering But they can take on physical forms dimensions different forms of people animals Maybe even inanimate objects possibly you know speaking through plants Like the imitemias as is of the jinn There was plants that would inform people of their benefits of the plant And again, that's interesting if you look at ayahuasca for example Like how do these natives in the forests when there's thousands of species of plants Some even poisonous that can kill you How do they discover the plant that can take you on this psychedelic journey And remove some of the veils of the the conscious You know to into a different dimension how you know and if you look at even the jinn can't Speak through these plants teach people of their benefits So they can do loads of things like this right? They've the form they choose may depend on the circumstance What are they trying to achieve in that specific case interdimensional beings? That's one way you prefer to them in modern language. Mm-hmm interdimensional beings Spiritual being some would say Being from a different plane. So there's many ways you can refer to it. Do the good jinn ever try interacting with us I don't know for certain I would assume based on what we know that they would stay to themselves Right they will be no need for them to engage with us interact with us But I can't be for sure But the evil jinn definitely do and they can They can claim that they are good Right, so again, it muddies the waters like what do you what do you trust then? You know, how do you know if this jinn is actually good or we actually evil, you know because of the deceptive nature? Okay, the average Muslim person my age 31 no yeah, although this human like 24 in this age range Uh Do they know these things? Everything we're speaking about? No, most know so there is some level of knowledge extraction which is valuable for the average Muslim that's coming on Part of this conversation is 100% yeah, I think generally for people is all man because uh One thing even if you're not from a Muslim background You will hear this conversation be like, you know what? I know of these beings maybe from a different culture Like for example in native American culture they call skin walkers Right the Irish called them the good people or fairies right same thing when you study what these beings are How they shape shift and appear and disappear and the powers they have We're talking about the same being right because again Islamicly like I mentioned earlier If you look at the history of religion Asologically Islam ties altogether It's the same God is the same creator he sent messengers throughout history to different people in different nations talking about the same fundamental truths And so it's not surprising that you find the mention of these beings in other cultures and other traditions So yeah, sure they refer to them as different names, you know, but it's the same being essentially, you know Whatever you call it your my fourth or colored podcast of this trip and that's what I wished for I wished for multiple But I've come to realize that Britain is a fairly haunted place Oh, yeah, it has a very dark history man very dark history, right? I hope this podcast is no more than just the occult But there's definitely a powerful we'll discuss About it because I the way I see the occult is generally overall. It's a very dark thing Right, it's a very dark thing and people should try not to miss because look the We could be spending a time in so much in such a more profound way by trying to connect with the positives Side our spiritual selves develop ourselves spiritually growing closer to God, etc Instead of losing ourselves in the dark side if you like But UK yeah, it's definitely a dark has a dark history, you know, there were loads of witches and witchcraft and You know the the more ancient religions of the UK had a lot of Dark practices and stuff like this yet definitely you feel it well living you it depends where you are like I've had I've had certain experiences which I can't talk about Like because there's a time we were doing a lot of travel because of work And we would end up staying especially when you go into the countryside It's not so much in the cities and we'd end up staying in some you know old bed and breakfast or you know In some very old building and It wouldn't always be that comfortable man. There you would snow is things off Sleep that night and you'll see things in your dream Yeah, and you'll just get this vibe is feeding sometimes, you know, but yeah, man. This stuff is very dark He's always sometimes We will move on to the UFO session That's the main aspect of this podcast, but we had to set context until this point So this whole UFO meets the world of gins That's what fascinated me about your profile immensely I didn't know that this is the depth of your knowledge when it comes to the Quran and gins in general bro It was that topic first and foremost I'm very curious to know where that exploration began Okay, so maybe a couple of years back I was always New by the topic of the gen. I was never really that interested in it All the occult and again, I knew about it did some research on it years back never really got into it wasn't an interest But when I saw you know the interest that the topic of UFOs was getting Especially in the West in America over the past couple years especially of the 2017 New York Times article that was published New York Times is one of the most reputable news outlets in America So they did a whole piece on the UFO topic and the whistleblower and stuff like this new Elizondo came out As I paint attention to that topic Could you give us some context on this? Yeah, so 2017 I mean the UFO topic is gone hot and cold over the decades 2017 the New York Times again published this article and they started this whole upward trend towards we're interest towards UFOs again and I started looking into it because look you know serious people were talking about now and no longer you know It wasn't the case of guys with tin foil hats in the middle of the Nevada desert, you know, Roswell You know, so where's looked down upon so much so that you know they to show the seriousness in the topic They even changed the term UFO. They call it UAP's now You know unidentified aerial phenomenon So they changed this term as well just to So the subject is taken more seriously and then those congressional hearings There was whistleblower that came out whistle blows meaning people from the government that came out said yes, this is real UFO is a real we don't know what they are but they You know they're in the skies they're running circles around our most prized technology And they're a problem, you know from a natural security standpoint They're a big problem and if it is you know adversary technology China Russia whatever the case is That's still a problem right because they've outdone us in leaps and bounds So they showed there's a there was the governmental angle which brought seriousness to the topic That got me into it and I started to notice patterns in the appearance or display of this UFO phenomenon and Of the gin So I started doing some studying research into and I realized that well one It's not a new thing that the American governments talking about this stuff's been studied for decades I think around the 50s the Christians were speaking about the topic of UFOs And they interpreted it as demons basically now the concepts in Christianity the concept of demons in Christianity or fallen angels Is slightly different than in Islam? So the concept in Christianity is that these are angels that have basically turned dark Right and become evil Whereas in Islam there's no kind of angels don't have free will so they never disobey God Therefore they can never become evil in the first place but there are the gin and I think some of them misunderstanding comes from The fact that Oblise what like we said in the beginning shaytan was a worshipping god amongst the gin He was in the ranks officer the ranks of the angels So therefore it can become confusing very quickly for people So anyway they they they will Interpreting them as demons or fallen angels So that was very interesting. Those Christians speaking about this since the 50s Some of the main researchers in the field of ufology like Jacques Valet for example The most eminent guy he's like the godfather of the topic the the whole topic He's a computer scientist one of the guys that first worked on the internet when he was coming out Very brilliant clever guy. He wrote several books on the topic And his conclusion in his academic his conclusion was that this this phenomenon as he referred to it Is no extraterrestrial meaning it's not aliens from another planet And he's written papers on this as to why he doesn't believe this in the case one example He gives as well if intelligent life from somewhere else in the universe is traveling light years and has the technology to do so Is gonna sum up crush on the earth I mean they're not gonna put any fail saves in place for that doesn't make sense and he had many other arguments for this But any any how his conclusion was this is something else and he also said that this phenomenon has been witnessed throughout history And many cultures he referred to and religions that talk about this phenomenon and calls it different things by different names And he talks about Irish law a lot as well So I found that very interesting that this serious researcher, you know an academic Is coming to this conclusion and then I started looking at some of the other academics They were talking about this stuff D. W. Pusoka religious studies profess in America You know she talks about the uf of phenomenon and how yes in the media you see one angle of it these things flying in the air And people being abducted and so on But there's a very dark side to it that the people that have these experiences with UFOs That when they go after the experience they have many other experiences You know, or people that study this topic the families are affected Right there's this they refer to as the hitchhiker effect Right they've got a term for him which basically means when someone has an experience with a UFO Or a UFO experience Something follows these people becomes attached to these people and affects their lives Their families their kids the neighbors even right it's like a virus even if they're just studying it Even if they just study here like there's been some government officials Jim Simivan X C I A agent he's on YouTube you can see his stuff He was studying this topic and he and his family had experiences Luella Zondo the most famous whistleblower that's come out now He was in the recent congressional hearing he wrote book recently called imminent He said that you know when he got involved in the study and he was heading the project secret project in the government to study UAP UFOs He said when he got involved in the study of it He started to see lights green orbs flying through his home and lights and the sky and stuff like this So you know there's this phenomenon the hitchhiker effect as they call it and again There's a historical precedence to this so I started to see this and hold on a second There's something very interesting going on here My studies in the Jin and different religions and how they understand these beings that are between not God but not human But somewhere in between and the UFO phenomena seems to be a link here So I dug dove into it a bit more and I came across you know so many similarities and parallels and my conclusion after doing the study was well What people are witnessing or calling UFOs or alien beings and now they call them NHI non human intelligence right Is actually the same phenomenon just appearing or manifesting in a different way right Manifesting in a way that's appeasing to and makes sense to a techno secular mind There was an article published and research gate a few months ago Where these academics, you know said that it could be it doesn't have to be ET It could be other things as well It could be you know They had a pattern called magical Entities or something like that and within the spoke about Jin and other beings, you know from other cultures so I found the similarities was just amazing man You know and that's what led me to the conclusion that It's actually what we're seeing is just gin manifestations. But what's going on? Why? Because so there's a few parallel Parals I could share with you. So first is the appearance Right, so when you talk about appearance or manifestation? What do people see when it comes to the UFO phenomena? They sing lights orbs in the sky They are seen cryptid sometimes weird looking creatures that appear in disappear They sing these typical gray aliens as they call them, you know very popular in pop culture Gray's big heads black eyes You know, they are Having experiences with beings that telling them certain things which are not always true Giving them a certain purpose they being abducted by these beings. So let's look at the appearance lights orbs creatures Alien-grade type beings The gin manifestations if we see lights orbs Right Appearing taking taking on the shape and form of different creatures and animals The Alice the Crowley the being that he contacted long which we mentioned earlier if you look at the picture of that being and you look at the typical Gray it's almost identical big head large eyes small features small being etc So the appearance was very similar, right? Then the abduction phenomenon, right? So we know that Duction phenomena is massive in the UFO, you know culture People have been abducted they report the abductions. There was a Harvard professor He was the head of psychiatry in Harvard and he wrote a book called abductions He published an academic piece and what he concluded from all of his research and interviewing Hundreds of thousands of people that abduction experiences that this is a real phenomenon This is not mass hysteria people actually experiencing something, right? Now We find the abduction phenomenon within The gin as well Right, so for example at the time of Umar one of the companions of the prophet when he became caliph during his time There was a man who just disappears Right and his wife comes and says my husband's disappeared after a while and she wants to move on with the life etc Long story show after many years he appears again Right and the old and he asked somebody's family and the Umar says to him that well, you know, where did you go? You disappeared didn't tell anyone just vanished He says the gin took me away. They abducted me And they kept me as a prisoner And then after many years another group of gin good gin came and they Fought them they overcame them and then they gave me you know because they couldn't keep me They said look would you want to return to your family or stay with us? Is your choice? And he wanted to return so they returned him back And he accepted this as an excuse So this shows that the abduction phenomenon was something common and experienced at the time You know in the last section you mentioned something about historical references of gins What was mentioned historically also so there's actually a very good book The world of the gin The Arabs and the world of the gin it's an academic book I can give you the reference of it and This also does a historical sweep of Arab folklore and literature and all of this stuff because there's a lot of it there And you know the also gathers these reports of all these different Arab tribes and in communities that have had experiences with the gin And it relates them and brings them together. So there's a lot of information there about interactions between men and gin From an Arab context basically There's another book called the world of The fire spirits. I think it's called that or I'm paraphrasing the title and again The author does something similar but also brings in other cultures and traditions African, San Zibo etc. All different parts of the world and again, collates those stories of these experiences which are very interesting Hmm a friend of mine Who's an explorer? He's like dedicated his whole life to cycling in the enderios of the world. Wow. So He's been on show's names a Raj Fund and the cycle Baba is his YouTube. Wow. Okay told me once about this Group of people. It's a nomadic tribe in the enderios of Saudi Arabia who are a little War like Little like rough. Yeah, have you heard of this? Yeah, not of that tribe, but are some Arab Bedouin tribes are known to be rough in their character. Yeah, I would assume that if anyone has had any kind of interactions It's these interiors of the desert kind of people Because in the desert There's no clouds. Yeah, and you're able to see really far anyone seen it. It's them I would assume that All the desert oriented cultures of the world have had more interactions with these things Yeah, not only desert I would say desolate places which are not occupied normally by human beings So you wouldn't find most people having experiences with these beings in cities or populated areas According to Islamic narrations that these beings, you know, once they had style of spreading corruption and bloodshed That God sent the angels Including a bliss who was amongst the angels to to basic there was a war that took place on earth and they pushed these beings to desolate areas Caves and mountains and dirty places places which weren't inhabited now whether it was in this dimension or another dimension Again, that could be speculated upon but you would find even through folklore and the religious texts that you normally find these beings to inhabit desolate areas and places where people don't normally live So yes, deserts would definitely be a place I've done enough podcast by this point to know who's sitting in front of me. You're a very pure hearted person Hope I am I hope that's the case man. You're very kind of my flows. Yeah, very very connected That's how I describe you. Okay. You're genuinely connected to the source I would I would like to believe so yes And I can see how it's taken effort and practice on your end to get to this point Not practice discipline is a world adios Fantasy yeah when I first got involved in social media You know, I came into it very pure. I want to do this for the right reasons I had found guidance. I wanted to share these things with people Yeah, no in force, but just share with people because I they were they were human just like me They deserved to know things just as as much as I did But when I got involved in social media and online and started getting popular and famous We used to go to Hyde Park speakers corner and we get very popular at one point right It's social media is just taking off back then I'm talking 12 to 13 years ago It started affecting me spiritually Right I was doing things for the views and the numbers not necessarily doing things which were true and I Again commend you for something you mentioned earlier as all that you you talk about things that you want to talk about Regardless of how negatively impacts your social media and that's powerful man Honestly, you know hats off my life is very powerful. There's something for people to learn that getting involved in social media I have a lot of work to do in myself, you know I've made many mistakes. I fall short all the time I'm human at the end of the day, you know, but What's beautiful again is that God doesn't look for perfection. He's looking for persistence a persistent effort Yeah, are you gonna make the effort to fix yourself? You know we humans we're gonna make mistakes God mentions You if it is a very powerful narration in his own Which means that we've got mentions if you stop sinning You know God will remove you and replace you with another creation Because it distinguishes us from the pure high being we are not perfect. God is perfect We will make mistakes our job is when we made a mistake recognize our mistake learn from it Seek forgiveness from God and become a better person So we're all in working progress Matt. So am I you know I'm not that pure or that perfect. I make loads of mistakes But I try to keep you know working on myself One last question and feel free to answer feel free to not okay It's the concept of time And time is something that I'm trying to get to the bottom of In terms of philosophy What does the Quran say about time? Islam, we know God knows everything past present feature. You know everything right? He has determined all of this But we have to also remember that it's coming from the being that's not bound by serial time Right, so it's all the same for us. Yes, we're not in the future. We're not in tomorrow yet tomorrow We tomorrow so from our vantage point we can't see that So it's it's something that you know To fully comprehend is beyond us But I think in no understanding is is power because it makes you realize and humbles you as a human being That they are limitations as intelligent as God has made you there's some things you'll understand some things you want At time is a fascinating thing, you know It passes by sometimes it feels like he's going very fast like I felt like this was 20 minutes As far as sometimes it just drags and it's very slow You know, but it's very hard to grasp what is it? You know essentially I'm having a ball. This is a great podcast. Likewise, man. It's been this is fun. I've really enjoyed just this session I really appreciate for you letting me you know express my thoughts and and discussing those thoughts with me And your style of going back and forth is very powerful as well Because you know it wasn't just sit back ask the question doing your job You know you were you were actually engaging which is very powerful and I think stuff like this is very powerful for The youth especially out there regardless of what background you come from to learn about You know other traditions and other ways of life and to really try to understand them beyond the The politics and the nonsense that's how they pretty much yeah I think it's also why old media is dying The news wants to create Divisions yes and I personally believe that new media Definitely can create divisions But instead we should try creating multiplications. Yeah because through cross cultural knowledge that's where Your knowledge gains with and depth Rather than just gaining depth out of like one piece of information. Yeah So my intention with this whole tour of my show was to gain cross cultural knowledge And I say it again I said it you in the breaks I said it you before the show I prayed for you to visit the realms of this show So thank you brand now. Thank you for having me on man And like I said, you know make God guide you make God guide me and make God guide all of us We're all on a journey right and make God facilitate that journey for all of us You know as long as we can facilitate some learning for people That's the best we could here's to many more conversations over the years. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. This was just the beginning Thank you. Excellent. That was the episode for today ladies and gentlemen I'd love to know what you guys thought of today's episode.
