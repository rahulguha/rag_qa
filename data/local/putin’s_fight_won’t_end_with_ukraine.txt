In many ways, I don't think that Russia's goals have changed very much since the outside of this war. The war is not sustainable for Russia. If you look at material constraints, if you look at economic factors. But currently, it is more sustainable for them than is for Ukraine. After three years of war, the mood among many of Ukraine's allies has turned to grim. Russian forces are making steady gains, key-vis running low on ammunition, and a return of Donald Trump to the White House has only added to anxieties about the conflict, casting doubt over not only the future of American military aid, but also the prospect of an negotiated settlement that has satisfactory to Ukraine. In an essay for Foreign Affairs titled Putin's Point of No Return, Andrea Kendall Taylor and Michael Kaufman argued that the risks are even greater. That Putin's rush will pose a threat to Western interests, even if the current fighting in Ukraine ends. Kendall Taylor is a former intelligence official and scholar of authoritarian regimes in Russian politics. Kaufman is one of the most astute analysts of the war in Ukraine. I spoke with them about the battlefield dynamics and the political dimensions of the conflict and about Vladimir Putin's enduring ambition to reshape the global order. Andrea and Mike, thank you for the essay and our current issue. It's called Putin's Point of No Return. It follows a couple of other fantastic essays that two of you have co-authored over the past few years. I would point back especially to a very prescient one from 2021 about what you called Russia's persistent power and the then common mistake of writing off Russia as a disruptive force in geopolitics. It was the kind of argument that ran against conventional wisdom when you wrote it and then seemed totally obvious and undeniable a year later. So I'll just say it's a pleasure to have both of you joining me today and there's a lot to talk about. Thanks for having us. No, thanks. So I thought it would be useful to start by getting a sense of where things stand in Ukraine, in Russia and in US interactions with both given what tumultuous and high-stakes stressors and with Trump's recent return to the White House. We're also, of course, approaching three years since the start of Putin's false-scale invasion of Ukraine launched on February 24th, 2022. So Mike, I want to start with you on the state of the battlefield. There's a dominant sense in Washington, at least that Russia is even at immense cost and menomaterial, kind of grinding a long day by day with momentum on its side and with very little to suggest that Ukrainian forces can and will reverse that momentum. Is that, I think, that common view is that roughly accurate, how would you describe the current balance in the war? Yeah, I think that's a fair view. Voshel's had the initiative along most of the frontline and the material advantage for well over the last actually year of the war. I think particularly in the last six months and 2024, the Russian rate of gain began to accelerate on the battlefield. It's still down somewhere with a course of December going to January, but it's not clear that the Russian offensive is really being exhausted yet. And as we enter 2025, Ukraine is on a rather difficult position. The frontline is not imploding, the situation isn't catastrophic, but the war's been on a rather negative trajectory and visibly so for the past year. And it's not clear that much of that's going to change in 2025. If we look at where Russia and DC is, if we look at where European capitals are, not only is there a great deal of global uncertainty, it's not clear what funding will be available. Inventories are now doing great in terms of equipment availability for Ukraine. Ukraine is improving very resilient, they're holding on, but it increasingly looks as though Russia will keep making steady incremental gains over the course of the coming months. And if you look at some of sort of key battles reactions from last year, Ukraine is holding to maybe around 30% or a little more of the curst salient that they captured last year, it's steadily dwindling. Russian forces still advancing in the east and de Nyats and coupians by Harkobobos, they're not able to achieve big operation significant breakthroughs, but the way they are fighting, they've been able to sustain pressure across parts of the front and have been able to replace those losses. So their gains are very costly, but nonetheless they've been able to sustain them. And so that's sort of where we are this year. A lot of folks are hoping that maybe the Russian economy, which is increasingly creaking and showing visible cracks, that that is going to be a decisive factor, but many of the people ideal with their very skeptical that that's going to be decisive in 2025. We'll pick up some of those economic questions, but just to stick with the battlefield for a moment Mike, I know you're too smart and too judicious to make predictions along these lines, but as you look at the risk of a really kind of precipitous collapse in Ukrainian lines or conversely kind of massive shift in momentum in Ukraine's favor, do you see any signs that either one of those could come or or is there anything that would lead to that kind of change and the kind of war we're saying? So I do think that Ukraine's manpower situation is quite precarious and the way I look at it is that while the Russian military, the way it's fighting does not have the potential for some kind of big breakthrough and people only try to think of a breakthrough collapse on the front, they sometimes struggle to conceptualize, but what does that mean in this war? We don't see big combined arms maneuver operations very much in this war. And so no, Russia is not likely to capture major cities such as Harkov in Nipro, it's not even necessarily likely to be able to punch through all the way to the Nipro river, but if Ukraine is not able to stabilize the front line, then the Russian rate of gain makes celebrate month by month, which is exactly what was happening in the second half of 2024. And as Ukrainian manning levels decrease and as the force becomes less and less cohesive because sort of fragments that's trying to defend with your and fewer people, then you can see real problems where Russians begin to sort of be their march steadily west towards Nipro or they basically are advancing in a race such as much harder to organize a defense, right? And the point of discussing that isn't that I think Ukraine is at risk of Russia suddenly seizing a lot more territory. It's that if you appreciate the both sides are kind of positioning for likely negotiations this year to achieve some kind of arm assist or cease fire. If one of them has clear momentum on their side and is visibly winning in a sort of decisive manner on the battlefield, that has very significant implications for anything that happens that's a negotiating table, right? The fighting and what's happening in the war provides information about both sides leverage and their prospects in this war, and so it's going to be very difficult for Ukraine to achieve war termination on favorable or even acceptable terms if that is the case six months from now. Andrea, let me turn to you and that's a good segue to try to understand the Trump and Putin dynamic right now. How do you read signals from Putin about both the war and the US Russia relationship and of course the crucial interaction between those two things and how do you read signals from Trump and the people around him over the several weeks I suppose in the election? Yeah I think it's kind of like a tale of two different stories where with Putin it's been kind of steady as she goes whereas Trump we're really seeing some more significant changes in how he's approaching it. So I think from Putin's perspective it picks up exactly from where Mike left off which is that Putin does see that they're still able to accomplish some of their aims on the battlefield and so he really has very little interest in any genuine negotiation and as Mike said you know the economy might be pinched or tightened but still for at least 2025 I think he believes that he can ride this out and the pain isn't sufficient to force any significant change in his approach to the war in Ukraine. Where we're seeing more change as I think on the US side and of course in the run-up to the election through the campaign I think there was a whole lot of anxiety in Europe in Ukraine and certainly in parts of Washington that Trump would come in and really pull the rug out from under the Ukrainians and force them to make significant concessions and he famously talked about ending the war in one day. That rhetoric has really changed quite significantly and I think that there's a realization whether he's being told by the people around him or you know what it is that Putin isn't interested in the deal that Trump and his team had put on the table. You know one of the big sticking points I think is not so much over territory but really about Ukraine's ability to defend itself in the future. So there's certainly the question about NATO membership there's the question about the size and just position of the Ukrainian military moving forward and those are concessions that Putin is not yet willing to make whereas the Trump team is saying we're going to come in and continue to support the Ukrainian military and Ukraine's ability to defend itself. So now in the last week you know Trump's rhetoric has changed he's saying to Putin we can do this the easy way or the hard way he's talking about putting you know quote unquote sanctions on Russia. It's hard to know exactly what he means given that there's still so sanctioned in the United States really imports very little if anything from Russia but the shift is meaningful I think and I do think that maybe that there is this realization that Putin is not yet ready to engage and so I think we're seeing a President Trump who's trying to increase leverage but it's clear that it will take much more than the kind of cheap talk and it will take some real action I think to convince Putin that he means business. I mean if you do take seriously that increase in leverage or I guess some people call this the US version of escalate to deescalate to create pressure on Putin is there anything that could be meaningfully done there. I mean are there steps that you would look to that might change Putin's calculus and it's a meaningful way or change my metronaut battlefield. I think the most meaningful thing that the Trump administration could do would be to renew military aid to Ukraine to go back to Congress asked to pass a new supplemental package and really I hope Ukraine to stabilize the front line. I mean that's I think at the end of the day that's going to be what it takes Putin has to understand that they can't achieve their aims through the battlefield while continuing to fill the economic pains. I mean Putin has to come to the realization that he can't sustain this war indefinitely and in order to get there it does require Ukraine to stabilize the front lines. I personally think that Trump could sell that to Congress. He really controls the Republican Party thoroughly at this point and is so if that's the course that he charts then I think the Congress and his supporters would come along. But I guess on some level the most important signal is not any particular capability or step but just signaling that the US is there for the long haul. Yeah I agree. Mike I'm curious for your view on how an increase in US pressure or the decision to send new capabilities or put other kinds of pressure on Putin might affect things on the battlefield. But also to address what I think is the criticism that is implied to that theory that there were things that the Biden administration could have done and did not. Whether that's specific weapons they could have given it to not or only did after weeks of pre-verication or delay or some of the restrictions they put on how Ukrainians could use those weapons. There's a theory out there that that would have materially changed the course of the war and that if Trump takes those off that will somehow reverse momentum. So as you look at those two pieces both back we're looking at forward looking what do you make of that. So first I know there's a theory in this discourse out there but I'm deeply skeptical of a monocosal theory of this war that places all the burden and causality for outcomes on the Biden administration in the United States. This has been first and foremost Ukraine's war and many of the key decisions made in this war were if not made by Ukraine they were soly made jointly. I think a lot of criticisms of how the Biden administration handled security so-called state-crank are very fair and it's difficult to engage in the counterfactuals of what could have been but I struggled to identify specific weapons that would have made such a dramatic difference in the dynamic and the course of this war. For some folks that may be a bit surprising to hear I think the challenge with that particularly early on is folks tend not to be appreciative of how much time it took to set up the security assistance pipeline and training maintenance would have you over the course of 2022 and that a lot of this simply wasn't just possible early on in the war that the reality of what it takes to make these things happen. I think at those juncture in the war the Trump administration have some options but they've inherited a fairly weak hand right first they don't have much in the way of funding. Second Ukraine's principle problem at this point in the war is not a deficit of ammunition or equipment although you can never have too much in the conflict such as this the leading problem Ukraine has manpower and this is not a problem the United States consult and it's become very evident that while the Russian advantage in artillery fires and in drones has been dramatically reduced over the course of 2024 such that in many areas Ukraine has on social parity the Russian rate of advance only increase along similar timelines right and so increasingly we can begin to isolate the leading challenges in Ukraine have to do with forced management force quality and mobilization. That said I think sustaining assistance for Ukraine will prove to be very important and there's still some key abilities in the United States has not provided that were discussed in 2024. I'm simply unsure how they can be decisive and the reason I say that is because most capabilities have their greatest impact when they are first introduced at scale and they need to be in support of an operation that takes advantage of their presence on the battlefield. Being in a large seal conventional war and just adding the latest missile to that war isn't going to change much of anything it's going to help but it's going to help by a matter of degree right it's not going to change the dynamic which you need is usually an offensive operation or a defensive operation or something concerted that you are doing so you do think that if Ukraine is able to stabilize the frontline in the coming months then some additional strike abilities could really increase the cost that Ukraine and Flicks on Russia could also allow Ukraine to pursue certain limited aims like halting Russian critical infrastructure strike campaign for example and it can be part of an approach sort of this year to try to rebalance the scales or at least the relevant balance of leverage in this war but it's important to get folks off of the notion that we've seen throughout the war that whatever next capability might be available whether it gets Western tanks, whether it's attachments missiles whether it's that of 16s but that's going to be the game change and unfortunately these capabilities don't compensate for problems with the fundamentals.

I want to jump into the recent piece I read it again this week and was struck by how both persuasive it is at the level of framing argument but also how full of just really sharp and well substantiated analysis it is kind of paragraph by paragraph. So there's a lot in it we will not get to today and people should go read it. But one piece of the framing argument that I want to draw you out on is the degree to which Putin has adjusted ideologically, politically, and economically to kind of a wartime footing, defining this war. Starting with the last one of those Andrea, the ability of the Russian economy to withstand pressure has been surprising to a lot of observers. You know this is at a moment when the two of you estimate that when you include unofficial expenditures about 8% of GDP is going to military spending, how has the Russian economy changed to withstand economic pressure in the sanctions regime and why is it it surprised us? I mean if you'd gone back a few years and listed everything that the US and its partners would have been doing to put pressure on the economy and just how much Russia would be spending on the war you would have I think suspected more of a collapse that we've seen. Yeah I mean I think it's fair to say that the impact of the sanctions and the export controls I mean they are unprecedented you know the freezing of central bank assets and other things it's been really a mighty effort by the part of the United States in Europe to try to raise the cost of a Putin of sustaining this war. But I think everyone would generally agree that the impact has been less than people had hoped for. And part of that is because you know you have been able to adapt to those sanctions and export controls over time. You know a large part of the resilience of the Russian economy has been the high defense spending that the government is pumping this money into the economy and that has had both benefits in terms of keeping economic growth much higher than most people anticipated. You know despite all of the pressure that the West has levied the Russian economy up into this point has continued to grow. So there has been a lot of dislocation but on the whole there's been quite a lot of resilience and the other key factor is certainly the support from external actors China first and foremost but also the India's and other countries of the world some of which chose not to implement sanctions in the first place but others like China that are actively helping Russia to circumvent the sanctions and export controls. So there's been a lot of different modes and methods of adaptation and as Mike has said it has created economic challenges. We know inflation is incredibly high. The ruble is very weak. There are labor shortages so it's not as if there haven't been costs. It has raised the cost for Russia of prosecuting the war but it just hasn't yet had the effects that I think that many in the West had hoped. Do you see space for the Trump administration in this search for leverage or the search for escalation to really ramp up the the economic pressure when they talk about maximum pressure and all kinds of context is there a maximum pressure course here that might put strains on the Russian economy that would make a difference? I think it a lot of that would have to do with the oil and the energy sector. So you have President Trump asking Saudi Arabian other countries to significantly up their production of oil to drive down the price. That would be a major thing. You know the United States and Europe have tried to put the oil price cap to try to reduce the amount of revenue that Russia can access as a result of selling its oil and gas. It's had modest effects and you hear the Europeans now talking about reducing the oil price cap so that would further reduce the revenues that Russia is able to generate. But really if we did see a precipitous decline in the price that would significantly curtail the amount of oil revenue that is basically allowing Russia to continue to prosecute this war pumping the billions of dollars into its wartime coffers. So that's one and then I think if they want to get serious about the enforcement of sanctions and using secondary sanctions that's another key way. I think that they could ratchet up the pressure. Mike do you see constraints potentially coming into effect on Russia's ability to sustain the war effort when it comes to both men and material. There's obviously all this focus on the outside help that Andrei referred to but in the kind of more purely military sphere when you look at the missiles and drones and other things coming from Iran and then of course the 10,000 or whatever it is North Korean troops that have gotten lots of focus is all of that kind of essential to keeping the war effort going or there are kind of constraints that that might start to bite if we do in fact manage to sustain Ukraine. Yeah Russia does face material and manpower constraints right on the material side the challenge they have is that they mostly fuel this war by pulling equipment out of storage which they inherited from the Soviet Union. So this is essentially the last war of the Soviet Union of Russia spending through its Soviet legacy. I think particularly Russia is going to have challenges in the second half of this year to keep going this way. But it doesn't mean the Russia is going to run out of equipment. It means that the way they fight it's going to be focused on reducing losses of mechanized equipment and it means that they are going to struggle to sustain momentum on the battlefield even in times when they do have breakthroughs to tactical level. On manpower. So they had issues last year that don't look like recruitment went up but they went up because they started offering payouts at five to six times they weren't previous years of the war. In Russia as well manpower even though Russia is plenty of people playing men. Russia is almost no unemployment. It is a very very tight labor market. It has very significant shortages of skilled labor and so the Russian state along with the Russia and Kami are competing for what manpower is available and at a certain point is it's not going to be worth it to go to this war or the state will not be able to offer the payments you would need to further attract people because they've already been recruiting people at a rate of around 30,000 men per month almost for the past two years right. And at a country that has these sort of labor shortages these challenges in terms of manpower and demographics. It's just a lot of the resources the Russia has are not necessarily available and they probably don't want to go to another partial mobilization either because first and foremost not because of political effects but because of how economically damaging the stabilizing that will be given the position they're already in. So, man probably a constraint as well and what that suggests to us is that if you crank in a dress of issues it does have a shot at exhausting the Russian offensive potential at some point this year. I just don't know that they're able to do these things but nonetheless Russia faces I think very strong headwinds in the second part of 2025 and so the Russian position overall is actually weaker than I think it appears and certainly their hand is weaker relative to their maximal aims and demands right. Old way their combat performance and the material constraints that they face in 2025 are going to create challenges for them in any negotiation. Andrei to focus on the kind of political piece of that and what it means for Putin the two of you right in the new piece that his increased reliance on repression has generated risk to the stability of his regime. You have a new book, the Rhethe Erika France on personalist autocracy is and in a piece that you and Erika wrote shortly after the start of the war you noted that these kinds of regimes look extremely stable right up until the point they aren't there have obviously been lots of moments in the war when people were predicting the eminally downfall of Putin especially when Pragojan was on his way to Moscow and looked like he was going to get there but you know as you look at Putin now and you look at all the kind of false dawns that we've seen in the last few years do you see signs that his grip on power might be weaker than we think or you know are there things that you're looking out for that would suggest that he's starting to see real political threats? Well just like Mike likes to avoid making forecasts about exactly which way the military or the situation is going to go so too what I like to avoid making any forecasts about the longevity of any dictator especially one as personalized as Putin but that caveat aside I think at this moment there don't seem to be as many visible threats to his hold on power and I think in large part it is because the repression has been so successful and because he was able to weather the Pragojan incident to basically then blow his plane out of the sky and demonstrate to you know traders or others what happens to those who oppose them along with the repression against every day Russians I think just the space for speaking out has become so non-existent that it's difficult to imagine in this moment anything genuinely threatening his hold on power and to maybe ask a question a slightly different way that will not ask you to make predictions you know you've studied lots of regimes like this you've studied Putin very very carefully what are the things that you are looking out for as indicators that might be changing what would we see if there were real threats to him? I think at the end of the day it really would be a confluence of factors and I think it would be naive to think that any one factor could bring down a regime that's so entrenched as the Putin regime is but you know about economy creates conditions that might be more conducive should another exogenous shock happen also looking for signs from the elite about any sorts of discontent or dissatisfaction over the future trajectory you know it'll be interesting to see what happens as negotiations if they do begin if there are disagreements about what Russia should accept what it should not accept so I think a lot of it would be kind of signs from the economy and then kind of elite support for Putin and whether or not you begin to see any vocal opposition to that but again I think at this point in time it's really difficult for me to imagine that the caveat is always like these regimes are stable until they're not. I mean you kind of of imagine how quickly we went from all assuming that Bashar al-Assad in Syria was kind of coming back into the good graces of polite international society or regional society at least to falling very precipitously it's a reminder of that. Let's go to the negotiations question Mike I mean you spend a lot of time in Ukraine including with Ukrainian officers and troops and other decision-makers and voices and politics in society. Do you see an openness to new kinds of thinking about negotiations and kind of accepting that not all of Ukrainian territories going to be back in Ukrainian hands in the near term or you know is there still resolve to keep fighting no matter what which is still the public message much at the time but I think it's very different from what you hear in private. I think the challenge that depends on who you ask of course there's an openness to negotiation and society increasingly 2024 and become tired and exhausted from the war those things are true but there's not an openness to making major concessions to Russia and that's the problem right and so what you often run into is that folks want to end the war but they're not willing to end the war at any cost and they certainly are not willing to end the war at a cost that then raises the fundamental question of what was the point of fighting and sacrifice saying people for three years if you're ultimately going to concede to Russia or make concessions such that the war ends with Russia being able to impose its will and substantial limit Ukraine sovereignty right and that's where the crux of the matter I think lies converse I think folks are willing to keep fighting but it's clear to everyone that there's there's not been a great sort of theory of success that they can identify neither in the west or in the United States or to be very frank in Ukraine over the past year right if it's out there it's a little kept secret and so I think that's the challenge we're at right now the military maintains morale and has a spirit to fight right of course it's been diminishing over the course of 2024 but a lot of that has to do with exhaustion with lack of rotation with lack of replacements with certain force management choices like creating new brigades instead of sending replacements to existing brigades and these sort of decisions right morale on the battlefield is very localized I think people sometimes don't appreciate that unfortunately there's no such thing as a sort of general morale where you know Russians are at a six in Ukrainians are at an eight it really depends on what part of the front you are with the fight looks like they're the leadership the degree of support and what have it you mentioned the theory of success in Ukraine I'm curious to hear from both of you does Putin have a theory of success at this point Mike we can start with you so my sense of it is that the Russian approach right now is to use a combination of pressure at the front attacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure to increasingly make the situation unsustainable in Ukraine and then hope that they can convert this to decisive leverage at the negotiating table maybe in the latter half of 2025 they're also for my point of view stalling for time meaning folks often confuse irussian willingness to talk with the willingness to negotiate and they are not the same right if we look at the opening Russian position which is actually not to discuss the Russian Ukraine war but to reiterate demands regarding European security and aspects of the ultimatum's they issued back in December 2021 from my point of view is a stalling tactic right it is to begin to discuss the unnegotiable rather than the war itself and to see if they can buy time what because for now continuing the war to them as a better alternative negotiations they have to actually be compelled to negotiate ultimately all right now I think they also have goals that fundamentally or beyond their military means from my point of view yes Russia has minimal territorial aims capturing the donbas what have you those may be achievable in 2025 but the role of either destroying Ukraine's viability as a state or imposing the world such that they dramatically limit Ukraine sovereignty it's very difficult to see them having the military means to attain that and throughout the war from the very beginning of the full skill invasion Russia's had a rather visible ends means mismatch right in terms of the military available to achieve those goals so I think the theory of success for them is somewhat the somewhat elusive as well right but they increase at least or advantage right now on time the war is not sustainable for Russia if you look at material constraints if you look at economic factors but currently it is more sustainable for them than is for Ukraine I think unfortunately everyone looking at the trajectory of the war knows that under idea of a different view or would you put the theory of success in different terms I guess just focusing on the kind of political theory of success to put it very simply I mean it really is about Ukraine's capitulation I think it's about as Mike said impinging on Ukraine sovereignty to make Ukraine a neutral state to limit its ability to defend itself and protect itself in the future I do think that a theory of victory would be regime change to try to install a leader who will be far more compliant if they can't do it on the battlefield then I think they'll look for political means to do it to get rid of Zelensky and put in a leader who will be far more compliant to Russia's objectives I mean in many ways I don't think that Russia's goals have changed very much since the outside of the war to go back to the essay I mean the first part of the argument is about how much Putin and Russia have adapted to wartime reality but the other piece is what this means beyond Ukraine especially if there is an end to the war there and what you write is pretty forceful and unsettling on this point let me read a long quote here because I think it captures it really well you write that Putin is now more committed and average the war with Ukraine and his broader confrontation with the West although the conflict is first and foremost an imperial pursuit to end Ukraine's independence Putin's ultimate objectives are to re-litigate the post-Cold Order in Europe weaken the United States and usher in a new international system that affords Russia the status and influence Putin believes it deserves so there's a lot in that I mean on Drey on some level it seems like we're already seeing elements of this confrontation not just in Ukraine but everything that Russia is doing with kind of sabotage and hybrid warfare operations you know everything from fires and warehouses and these DHL packages that blowing up in planes cutting under sea lines and all of that how do you see that evolving and what is the kind of intention behind that is that just kind of Russian intelligence services going a little bit feral or is this part of a nascent strategy that is going to grow from here I mean I think it's part of a strategy whereby you know we might not see ourselves at war with Russia that Russia sees itself as being at war with us and so for the time being so long as the war Ukraine continues they're having to rely on these unconventional tactics the sabotage cable cutting assassinations exploding warehouses and arson and other things I mean those types of attacks and indirect actions in Europe are on a categorically different level now than they were before the war but there's also the way that it's directly supporting other US adversaries which I think it's kind of part and parcel of the same thing so they're you know giving more direct military aid and assistance to the North Koreans so in exchange for what they give they're having to give away increasingly sophisticated military technology so there's kind of the indirect stuff that unconventional war while at the same time I think they're enhancing military capabilities to spread the United States then kind of in other parts of the globe so those things are all happening and it is part of this much broader confrontation that Putin sees himself as engaged in he views the United States as in decline he wants to accelerate that decline and so he'll do it you know through sabotage and other things but also by emboldening his like-minded partners who are equally as committed two weakening the United States as he is and I should say you wrote a piece with Richard Fontaine last year called the axis of a people on that grouping I think that term is becoming one of the most widely used one the thing best captures what is common to the intentions of those for actors but I want to draw you out a bit you know as you look at the Putin side of this when he looks at European security architecture when he looks at these kind of questions of quibble order what is he trying to get at other than just causing trouble for the United States and European allies I mean I think at the end of the day it's about undermining US power and influence you know we saw all of the demands that Putin made at the beginning of the war about rolling back NATO and our presence in parts of Europe and other things so I think ultimately it's about pushing the United States out of Europe I mean ultimately Putin believes in spheres of influence and he would like the United States out of Europe and that's a kind of goal and mission that he shares with Xi Jinping who sees a sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and Iran in the Middle East so all of these countries I think are committed to diminishing US power and reestablishing these spheres of influence I mean I think it's really as simple as that I mean they have this vision of multi polarity where Russia is one of many polls but it is free to do as it chooses within what it sees as its own sphere and this is of course at a moment when Trump still occasionally talks about withdrawing from NATO which would be very much in line with that vision but to go back to the line to the two of you right that the Kremlin if there is a settlement in the war in Ukraine kind of just or not the Kremlin will look to pocket any concessions from the Trump administration threatening the current war such as sanctions relief to strengthen its hand for the next one Mike as you look at Russian planning and strategy here where do you imagine we might see that are there there are other military targets is it a place like you know transnestria the Russian mind breakaway region in Moldova is that you know the Baltics and kind of testing NATO resolve under Trump where you concern as you look at that next stage if there is one I mean my main concern is that there's going to be a third Russia Ukraine war this war is a continuation war of what began in 2014 and I think the challenge of all folks have looking at the prospect of a settlement this year is that ceasefire is not likely to be durable it's likely to be more of a piece of paper with a word ceasefire on that because as long as Putin's in charge of Russia his objectives are not likely to aim and there isn't much to prevent Russia from undergoing a brief rearmen period and then restarting war with Ukraine this time without the political assumptions designed without the mass of planning mistakes that they made in 2022 which were principally causal of the failure of that invasion the first 30 days having taken a lot of the lessons having substantially expanded the Russian armed forces over the last two years and that's what concerns Ukrainians right that if they make an agreement and there are no security guarantees at this point they look very unlikely okay certainly none that involved the United States in some way shape or form and they grant positions security guarantees that don't involve the United States are not worth that much to them they know and and Russians certainly know that once the war is ended Ukraine will have to demobilize some significant percentage of the army there will be elections there will be all sorts of civil political challenges which Russia can anticipate and that's what concerns the humane Ukraine the most whereas Russia is not going to face these challenges not necessarily although we can't predict what the state of the Russian economy will be a year from now I think that's very fair but nonetheless the situation for Russia is less uncertain right it's not just the conversation on how we end the war and just ending the war for the sake of saying you ended it isn't going to achieve war termination for you or any kind of lasting durable piece you also have to have a plan for how are you going to win the peace and how are you going to the Torah and lastly we're planning one of the key arguments that peace makes is the Russian reconstitution from the standpoint of the Russian military being able to pose a threat to Ukraine or two members of NATO in the Ableton duck a large still combat operations is not a question of if it is a question of when that much is clear now we are only debating the timelines and timelines we are debating at this juncture are not very long whether you think it's seven years or ten years or something like that ten years is often a minimum defense planning timeline for folks involved in defense analysis defense planning ten years is going to be around the corner you need to make decisions now to be properly positioned for a threat and to hedge against uncertainty that that threat both ten years from that right and so it's always a challenge of both conveying that no it's not necessarily tomorrow but this is an urgent challenge and leaders have to make tradeoffs and decisions now because if they don't we've seen the history of the last twenty years the price they will pay later for not making those decisions now would be infinitely higher this is sort of a scovag. It's conveying based on I think the experience we've had over the last two decades in European security and past administrations coming in consecutively all saying that they want to focus on China into Pacific park the relationship maybe compartmentalize it would have you and that only leading to a much higher cost of having to deal with Russia and Russian revenge. Yeah but I think the one thing I would add actually is I mean I certainly agree with Mike about the prospects of another Ukraine war but I also you know even though it's still kind of a low probability and a bit more distant prospect you can't dismiss the prospects that Putin would try to challenge NATO directly and the scenario that I think is the most likely pathway to a direct military conflict between Russia and NATO which we describe in the pieces one where the United States might be engaged in the Indo-Pacific and therefore Putin could judge that NATO but really read the United States would lack the political will and perhaps some of the resources to come to NATO's defense and that Europe on its own could not deter or defeat Russia at the end of the day and so it's that opportunism that I worry a lot about as Mike said it's not a matter of if but when Russia reconstitutes its military its aims are enduring we know what Putin is trying to accomplish and so he will be on the lookout for opportunities he already has the economy on a wartime footing he will rebuild the military and so he will be poised to seize on opportunities as he sees them. Mike let me quickly press you on one dimension of this and that's the nuclear question that's obviously been a factor in the war so far and kind of feeds into that critique you here of the Biden administration that it was overly jumpy when Putin would have resorted nuclear saber rattling but this I think become a question of urgency and a broader question in this existential struggle as you put it between Putin the West how do you see Russia nuclear doctrine playing into these dynamics especially at a time when China is rapidly expanding its own nuclear arsenal. So the conversation on risk of nuclear escalation of Russian curse of threats throughout the war is a really interesting one I think that early on Russia was very successful in the turning United States with uncertainty and folks can debate whether we were overly deterred by by these various particularly in the war but that being said I do think that the turning effect began to fray fairly quickly in the United States and European countries effectively salami sliced Russia over the course of the war such that if you were to be able to ask the Russian say did you want to end up at this point of the war in year three with US attack him's and GMLRS being fired directly in to Russia with US funding having gone to Ukraine to hope enable the expansion of a drone strike program that now has also conducting strikes in Russia with what happened to the Russian fleet in the black sea the the greed to which you have such extensive Western material support intelligence support what have you for the Ukrainian war effort suddenly Russians have hoped to control this and actually it's a story of what nuclear weapons don't get you right that's a different party to react differently to nuclear threats at the end of the day in these forms of escalations see in most recently when you have Russians uses new IRBM or ashenic to United States that might have not been unexpected or particularly impressive but it's clear that the Russian goal is to try to convey to Europeans that they're facing something like another European missile crisis right and to try to influence German decision making on other parties that had had greater effect right so we sometimes have an overly Washington DC focused understanding of the case I think it's much more effective on certain European governments and their decision making than maybe Iran so ultimately I think you can argue that yes Russia was successful early on in the trying greater US involvement than the systems at the beginning of the war and that might have played a role but looking at the kind of overall timeline I don't see as a success story for Russian saber rattling and what have you and lastly there really weren't fears of that nature past the October 2020 to crisis right and even then a lot of what I've read in public press and but skeptical of because I still have never seen reporting that there are discrete signs of any Russian preparations to employ nuclear weapons that kind of over signaling that you would see right meaning the worst nuclear crisis of this war wasn't really that bad that's what I'm trying to convey we're not exactly 1983 able Archer Andre let me close with a question to you that I'm somewhat sheepish about asking given if I go back to your 2021 piece the two of you wrote on the myth with a Russian decline you know you go back and catalog all of these false hopes of stabilizing or repairing the Russian relationship over past administrations but when you imagine a kind of indefinite freeze or indefinite tensions between Russia and the West given this year size of Russia the sides of the nuclear arsenal that's not a feature that we would wish to have in the international system indefinitely so I'm interested if there's any course you can imagine again looking over a decade or so that would kind of change this trajectory and kind of get us back to a true reset obviously reset is a loaded word you caution in your work with Erica that even Putin's death would not necessarily change this trajectory so is there anything I'm trying to look for a little optimism here is there anything you can offer I don't feel optimistic really at all I think there's very few reasons for optimism in this case because as you said Putin is committed to the course you know that's why we call the peace the point of no return he's committed to the course and I do think that even with a new Russian leader a lot of these kind of contours of Russian foreign policy are deeply entrenched and will outlive Putin and so I think really like the best that you can hope for is that we get our own house in order as Mike was saying we can invest in resisting Russian out or pay a far greater cost leader there's lots of foreseeable things that we can do that actually make the Russia challenge far more manageable down the line so it's about making this a manageable problem it's not going away so how do we manage it and we can make these investments in European security our allies in particular can do more to spend for their own defense to take on a greater share of the burden and if we do a lot of these easily foreseeable things if we just have the political will to do it then I do think the Russia challenge is a far more manageable one the other silver lining I guess is like on the arms control front and you do have now a president Trump and president Putin talking about what arms control might look like Trump is talking about more of a trilateral agreement but as we all know the new start agreement you know the last kind of pillar of this arms control regime expires in basically one year from now and so the clock is ticking and so how do we ensure that we can make the problem more manageable by making the investments while also looking to put some of these guard rails on the relationship that have existed in the past well I think that's what counts for optimism in January 2025 so we'll leave it there Andre and Mike thank you so much for the series of fantastic pieces you've done for foreign affairs and thanks for joining me today thanks for
