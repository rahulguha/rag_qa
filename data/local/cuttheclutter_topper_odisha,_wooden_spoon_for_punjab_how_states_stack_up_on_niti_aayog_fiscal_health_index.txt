This map is color coded you might think it is a heat map. It is a heat map. This is a rating or this is an analysis that Nithi Iogas done. As part of its report, Titan fiscal health index of 18 major Indian states. Fiscal health index 2025. It is a very fine report with very good data. In fact these days when you get data you have to say thank you very much. So, Simon Berry, Vice Chairman of Nithi Iog, CEO, BVR Subramanam, Arvind Virmani, noted economist, my old friend and fellow traveler. He is a member and also the division called economic economics and finance division. Economics and finance one team that is a division and it is said Dr. Prasantha Sahu, the senior lead with the team. All of them have done a fantastic job because we have got data. Increasingly we find that we get less and less data from the government and even when data comes it comes after a long lag. Like NFHS was the last one we got and we are hanging on to that National Family Health Survey 5. For many other indicators we have not had the consumer survey, employment surveys are usually inadequate. We haven't had the 2020 month census. That situation when we get authentic analysis. A lot of the data is taken from CAG reports. The financial data or fiscal data has been taken by Nithi Iog from CAG reports so it is authentic. It is available there but to collect out of there and to analyze it and to draw conclusions from it that is what smart people at Nithi Iog has done. So thank you very much. Now if you see this map go back to this map. That is a heat map. In that heat map red is bad right the redder it is the worst it is. The lighter it is the better it is so it gets but amber it gets it gets a bit orange then it gets a bit yellow then light green then deep green is the best. So if you see this map for example it is quite evident who is doing well, who is not doing very well on fiscal health and that really isn't something that should confuse us looking at the map. This is the state wise composite fiscal health index core heat map. This combines everything overall score overall score if you see you see what is red. The redest the redest in fact is Punjab. Punjab has been Punjab has been myred in debt. Punjab has been myred in overspending and now we have also had governments one after the other giving giving giveaways in Punjab freebies and giveaways and not really raising their revenues and not spending money in the right areas. I will give you more details as we go along again. Care lies not doing very well. Andra is not doing very well you might say that there is some reason there because Andra only came into being in 2014 and lost the engine of its economy that was Hyderabad. But at the same time over the years after that things have gotten worse and Andra will go through some granular data as we talk more states which are doing well. Surprise of surprises which is the state that is doing the best of all. Surprise of surprises its Odisha. Normally you would have thought Odisha is among the poorest states in India so that will be in very bad state. It is not in very bad state. It is doing very well. Again a surprise UP is not doing as badly as you might have imagined Gujarat as you would imagine is doing better. Rana again is surprise we would have thought that Haryana will be doing much better but it is not doing much better. And again there are reasons for it. We will come to that. In fact in this ranking Haryana ranks really low which is which is surprising given the fact that it is the third richest large state in the country. See this chart also the heat map will go away but it will keep coming back plus different iterations of heat maps will come in different iterations means again heat there will reflect the state's performance on different indices different parameters across which this rating has been drawn. So if you see this chart this ranking Odisha is at number 1 ranking is based on a score that is the FHI score. FHI is like the sum total I will give you the methodology in a minute. Sum total of all the indices which are then averaged out scientifically based on formula that I cannot understand but I will share them with you. Odisha there gets a score of 67.8, 67.8 that is fantastic considering the fact that Punjab which usually considers itself such a belabally state such a gongo state that is at 10.7. So Odisha is almost 10 times better than Punjab on fiscal health index that says surprise very big surprise again Haryana another gongo state at 27.4 that is again again a little little better than one third of the leader very bad. Number 2 after Odisha is Chathiskad at 55.2 go that you would expect it is also a small state usually we do not count go up because it is a very small state we usually look at states which are above 1 crore population but go ice 53.6, Jarkan that is a surprise 51.6 and Gujarat then comes at 50.5 again the two big surprises here are that the states of Jarkan and Chathiskad again which are seen as a very poor states and usually in our imagination we would count them among the Bhima rule states but they are not at least on fiscal health they are doing much better and contrary to the impression that might have spread in fact under Hyman Sorean Jarkan government has been run quite efficiently on many parameters of course Jarkan and Chathiskad have both benefited as as Odisha from mineral wealth because mineral wealth brings royalties and those auctions bring them revenues those are non tax revenues of these states so these states are really high on non tax revenues but the fact is you can get the money but what do you do with it you can still blow it up and you can you can ruin things but these states have one done it in fact just after them again it is a surprise just after just after them that is Odisha Chathiskad go Ashharkan Gujarat Maharashtra comes Uttar Pradesh with a score of 45.9 which excellent it is the leading Hindi Heartland state with a lot of poverty but 45.9 and as we look at some other data it will tell us that the state actually is fiscally quite well managed so it has it has responsible politicians and also responsible civil servants and this is not across one one party's government or two parties government this this comparison is over a nine year period from 2014-15 so to 2000-22-23 so this is across different parties governments in all the states. Now again if you see this chart a couple of things jump out at us debt index in is an indication of how healthy your debt situation is which means how much can you service your debt or how how less indebted you are their Odisha is at 99 which is fantastic Punjab there gets one big zero and that is why the result of debt sustainability for Odisha is 64 which is very high and for Punjab it is only 15.2 again Harayana it is a state we keep talking about also because it is seen to be a rich state the debt index compared to Odisha is 99 Harayana is 24.1 and that that sustainability is 14.3 some of the other interesting states Kerala the usual suspect Kerala the debt debt index is 23.1 sustainability 11.3 in very bad state West Bengal if anything even worse debt index 18.3 and sustainability 20.6 these are the states who are laggard and they are laggard also because they are fiscally very poorly managed now how is it that Nithi Ayogas done this if you see these rankings and if you see this map usually you would say there should be something like brilliant moderate average disaster or laggard and disaster like that but no Nithi Ayogas actually be very diplomatic in labeling the states in these categories this has been done a little bit like Nastri's cool teachers rank rank kids in the classroom because they don't want to tell any kid that that kid is not good enough so they say you are brilliant you are nearly brilliant you are about to be brilliant you should try to be brilliant you are most brilliant like that so everybody is called brilliant in some ways everybody is given some kind of positive rating so what has what has the Nithi Ayogas done in this case the four rankings are deep green achiever number one top of the pops number two front runner number performer and number four in deep red aspirational that's the reason I said everybody is described in some positive life as a teacher in a nursery school might do with all their kids now as we go along this maps will keep coming back but be careful as you observe them because the colors will change before I get there however let me just explain the methodology to you because that's important so these states have been assessed along five parameters these five parameters are number one quality of expenditure and I will explain to you what each one means quality of expenditure number two revenue mobilization number three fiscal prudence number four debt index and number five debt sustainability those are the figures I just highlighted for you comparing say Odisha and the laggard states like Pajab, Brianna, West Bengal and Kirillah now how do this how do these indexes work under each major index there are minor sub indices so under quality of expenditure see this chart also these are all from the Nithi Ayogas so thank you very much Nithi Ayogas under quality of expenditure you have total developmental expenditure as a percentage total expenditure if you spend 100 rupees or 100 crore rupees how much have it went towards development the higher the percentage the better it is the second part under the same head total capital outlay which is gross state domestic product GSDP again higher is better the more of your GSDP that you are spending one capital outlay the better it is many states however have very little left for capital outlay and those are the ones who get bad rankings and bad marks on this this is like an exam with five subjects so the first one is quality of expenditure the second one is revenue mobilization under that you have states own revenue as a percentage of GSDP and states own revenue as a percentage of total expenditure again fiscal prudence the third major factor against under that you have two subheads gross fiscal deficit as a percentage of GSDP and revenue deficit as a percentage of GSDP that index again a two at two to subintices under that number one interest payments as a percentage of revenue receipts and number two outstanding liabilities as a percentage of GSDP and finally debt sustainability it is growth rate of GSDP compared with growth rate of interest payments if your interest payments are rising higher than the growth of your GSDP then the growth of your economy then you are in trouble the higher the gap the deeper the trouble you are in but if but if your economy is growing faster than the interest burden on your state obviously you are doing better now what the analysts have done in this cases that they have taken values from all subintices standardized them into some kind of a normalization formula and divided them into two categories improvement index which are which are which are good indicators and deprivation index which are bad indicators and then they have arrived at a final composite FHI score by taking by taking the arithmetic mean of the five major subintices as calculated according to the formulas that you will see on your screen I can make no sense of them but you can see them I know many of you are brilliant at math so you can figure it out in any case I will share with you a link of the entire Nithi IO report I now bring you to this chart again taken from the Nithi IO report this chart tells you how each state's ranking has moved across these years if you see if you see the movement of these rankings Odisha was number one it stays at number one right the darker is now that is 2223 the lighter color is 2015 2014 2015 to 2021 22 that tells you the movement in the final year of this assessment Odisha was number one is number one go up was number two it has come to number three so on and so forth but you will see that just as Odisha has remained number one it was number one remained number one go up was number two okay became number three some have had a dramatic change Karnataka for example was number three it came to number 10 now I know this is a very polarized situation so people say oh maybe that's because that's when the congress took to cover but remember the congress took over in in May of 2023 this calculation is up to up to March 31 of 2023 in the 10 years before that both the BJP and the congress had been in power in fact for about a year Kumaraswami was also the chief minister although with the support of the congress party so every party has taken their turn and in the process Karnataka has slipped from number three to number 10 just as Odisha is number one remains number one or go as number two is three or they're about so so maintains its high position some also consistently maintain their low position so Punjab number 18 the last of the lot stays at number 18 West Bengal slight improvement from 17 to 16 thank you very much Kerala again slight improvement 16 to 15 Harayana no improvement 14 to 14 that is something Harayana really has to reflect on because something has gone wrong there it's a rich state unrepidacious person and we might talk about it as we go along and Bihar is worsened although not by as much as I would have imagined Bihar has gone from 11 to 13 because on some indicators Bihar actually has improved as we go along talking about more granular retail I will I will mention that jharken has made a remarkable improvement from 10 to the 4 months again we have to take a fresh look at the way himan soran has been running the state and also chathis could has been improving again it's a state that's been under the Congress and the BJP both parties before and after which brings us to our next heat map I told you the heat map will keep coming back however the colors will change the shades will change so this is the heat map based on ex quality of expenditures core that is when the state spends spends its money how wisely they are spending it and there you see you see the colors are varying the number one in this case now is Madhya Pradesh who would have imagined this Madhya Pradesh Shivra Singh Chohan it was under him all this while so he deserves the credit Madhya Pradesh number one Bihar number two which is quite a pleasant surprise and that's the reason in the overall rankings Bihar is not doing as badly as you would have imagined because we have our stereotype Bihar number two chathis card number three and audition number four now this is the top top four in the achiever section please underline the fact that three of the four states among the top four by way of quality of expenditure happened to fall in what might be called or what used to be called the Bhimarhus state so you see a great deal of discipline coming there however on the aspirational there is always pajab and Kerala aspirational as we know is a lollipop next heat map again the colors will change because the rankings will change the next heat map is on the revenue mobilization how good has a state been on collecting its revenue taxes and also raising non tax revenues which in the case of say Chathis kadjhar kanwadisha also Rajasthan is minerals because how much how much much can you collect on minerals which means how much how much mining did you enable with your governess governess because mining is a sensitive issue and you need good governance for good mining to take place productive mining to take place in this one goise number one Telangana number two that's for every mobilization Telangana helped along by the fact that Hyderabad's there Telangana number two but Odisha even here is in the top three in the achiever category and aspirational that is the lollipop category the last category Andhra Pradesh comes there that is the that is the flip side of the coin from Telangana Andhra Pradesh is there west Bengal is there the usual suspect Bihar is there very poor with revenue mobilization obviously this is the period in which prohibition has come into effect in Bihar and that has that has played havoc with the state's revenue collection and you can see their Punjab Punjab in fact for every new collection is not at the lollipop category it's a little bit better at number 14 in a ranking of 18 then then we come to the next heat map the next heat map is on fiscal prudence fiscal prudence state has the money right Ambaniy attendee khatsha rupaya that is usually usually the mindset of our governments that you might earn 50 pasa but you will spend one rupee right that's you opposite of my mom or anybody's mom would would tell us to run our households she would say better either or more than you spend or spend less than you earn right but when you are the government it doesn't matter because you can borrow you can back steal borrow tax whatever and everybody knows that the government will not go down and their government will not go bankrupt like that even when as well as government keeps running you take a keep for it when the what difference does it make that is why fiscal prudence is a very important quality and they are see see the toppers there and it's amazing at the bottom once again you have Punjab right who's seen tomorrow so leave for today Kalkakya Skopata so Punjab is the bottom Bihar is the number two from the bottom but who's the topper and that's an amazing surprise your topper is the state of jarka then of course go up which I had qualified earlier is a small state jarkan shatis kurd and odisha are among three of the four top states by way of fiscal prudence this keeps you a very good idea of how India is being governed at the granular level because India is a federal country it's governed in its states it's very important after these four India cheaper category the top category comes Gujarat and then another very good surprise front runner that's a second category the top of the front runners that is that is a rank six in the national ranking of these 18 major states comes Uttar Pradesh that's very good and we had told you just a while back that it looks like Uttar Pradesh has been quite conservative and quite responsible in managing its finances which means it has responsible politicians who haven't been spraying money around to buy votes and this is across parties and this is across parties because the BJP came to power in 2017 before that it was a Khaleesh Yadav's government and also Uttar Pradesh must have more responsible civil services as well and at the same time Uttar Pradesh must be having particularly responsible civil services as well so give credit where it's due now come to the next hit map and this is this is the debt index now we are getting into tricky areas because what happens when states have states have deficit they spend too much one job they spend too much they have deficit what do they do they borrow they borrow from the center there is bonds they borrow from left-right center because after all at the end of the day there is a sovereign guarantee debt index core we had told you earlier Odisha 99 score fantastic Odisha is number one Chathiskad is number two again it's counterintuitive you would have thought this is a basket case state but no and Chathiskad also has a history of a lot of giveaways and distributive welfareism against under the Congress as well as under the BJP before that Ramans Singh as well as Gopesh Bagel yet Chathiskad is number two for debt index Odisha is number one Maharashtra is number three Maharashtra Gujarat are to industrialize states so you can imagine that but again in the achiever category there are five states in the achiever category which is the top category jargon is number five in that category and bonds again if I want to give you the lollipop category or maybe maybe lollipop is to kind I'm not in our free school teachers so I have to I don't have to be so diplomatic or so kind of or so good to all the children let me call it the wooden spoon category the wooden spoon category Punjab is at the bottom again for debt index at number 18 number 17 West Bengal number 16 Kerala and number 15 Luh and behold my Rihanna now there are 18 states if I start going over each state then it will take a very long time the best thing you can do is go through the report of with the IO of which as I said I'm sharing a link with you but some highlights I will mention to you now on through the age that's a state that's particularly doing poorly see what's happened in under Pradesh on the Pradesh K-Pex capital expenditure both in social services and economic services that declined drastically how drastically it's declined in social services by hold your breath 84.3% and economic services by 60% 60.1% that is a disaster that tells you the state and its people have really been suffering they might have been given a lot of freebies free power free this free that but otherwise this is not work you want to see the disaster of anthropologist unfold its total capital expenditure in this period is just 3.5% of its total total expenditure which means which means if it spent a 1000 rupees only 35 rupees was invested in capital expenditure that is a huge disaster this was also if that it was also if you are not shocked enough 4.4% just 4.4% of the state's total borrowing so the state is borrowing and spending borrowing and spending on itself which means salary, pension, raises etc etc and also on welfareism and giveaways in contrast see Bihar Bihar is a state which normally you would have thought is doing the worst of all in Bihar capital expenditure is 14% of total expenditure in ungrides 3.5 in Bihar 14% so 4 times as much as other presentation terms of percentage of their total expenditure and their capital expenditure on social and economic services is 13% of their total that is again good pointer from Bihar Bihar also shows that they reduced their support non government colleges by 54.6% that is high and also they reduced their support to adult education programs by 98.3% now some reporter will have to go to the ground and figure out why this has happened and what is the impact of this I think that is a very significant point point the same time a couple of things have risen which are very significant as well and positive so there is a rise in training under rural development how much is the rise by percentage 305% report does not say about the basis but 305% looks impressive again investment on irrigation flood control has gone up by 1360% so some money has been saved in one place but invested in the other place but invested in a good place you want to see the disaster on the today which which I just talked about see these two graphics on your screen this is page 35 in the Nithi Iog report one one shows you capital outlay as a percentage of GSDP it is declining like this well below national average they dotted line the broken line is the national average and see how much lower it is from national average and how it is declining in entrepreneurship they are also see fiscal deficit and revenue deficit as a percentage of GSDP it is going up in both cases and above the national average the broken line again is the national average in Bihar you might see a better for capital outlay as a percentage of GSDP although although the state revenue as a percentage of GSDP both tax revenue and non tax revenue are below the national average that I am sure is also accounted for by prohibition now since I told you I cannot go over all 18 states I am doing a little favoritism and and looking at Haryana over some of the other bigger states if you see Haryana it says and the report says the growth in capital expenditure has not kept pace with the growth in GSDP since 2018-19 it constitute 1.4% of GSDP during 2022-23 and was less than the budget estimates the relative share of capital expenditure in the total expenditure has come down from 16% 16.4% in 2018-19 to 9.7% in 2022-2023 that means Haryana has that much less suddenly drastically less to spend on capital expenditure then it says Haryana's capital expenditure on social services is reduced by 31.3% and on economic services increased by 46.7%. 55% of total revenue expenditure was incurred on committed expenditure that is very high that is very high because the committed expenditure means expenditure that you know will go towards salaries pensions welfare employees running of the government paying for a establishment government offices electricity bills etc. That is committed expenditure or what you might call incorporate world as fixed expenditure. I would recommend to you only one graphic from this and that graphic tells you Haryana's the movement of Haryana's capital outlay to GSDP it does not make a pretty picture because the dotted line at 2.3% is the national average Haryana is well below that with 1.2%. If Haryana's layer can pajabi far behind so let me get Pajab also and Pajab deserves to get a special mention because it brings up the rear of this list unfortunately because Pajab and Pajab is not used to being the last anywhere but in so many of these indicators they are because Pajab's economy has been declining there are many reasons for it but Pajab's economy has been declining it used to be the number one among the major states in India that is states above one growth population today it is at number 13. Today it is at number 13 and declining further. See what's happening in Pajab. Quality of expenditure the report says the ratio of spending on social services as a proportion of total expenditure has decreased compared to national averages falling from just 12.9% in 2018-19 to 12% it was very low still declining this is for education and for health from 4.1% very low already to 3.9% now compare this with promises of spending a lot more on education and health actually very little is being spent by Pajab government so Pajab takes a big hit in these rankings for its quality of expenditure. In fact I would suggest that you look at four graphics from Pajab right four graphics one tells you capital outlay as a percentage percentage of GSDP second fiscal deficit and revenue deficit as a percentage of GSDP then states own revenue as a percentage of GSDP then states non tax revenue as a percentage of GSDP fourth and the most important the states debt burden compared to its GSDP there the states debt burden is the highest of all states in the country at 46.1%. If your debt is already 46% of your GSDP and if your interest payments already and if your interest payments already account for sorry and if your interest rates and if your interest payments are already way above the national average as compared to your economic growth then you are really in a debt trap and that that is the reality of Pajab. Put through today's witnessed a significant growth in social sector for both capital and revenue expenditure since 2018-19 had grew at a CAGR that is the compound annual growth rate of 27% and 9% respectively so the quality of expenditure is good and the report says capital expenditure as a percentage of total expenditure raised between 14.8% to 19.3% again compared this with what happens in Pajab and what happens in entrepreneurial age that tells you that Uttar Pradesh actually is in much more robust state and that is why its ranking is so much better than some of the other states which we might have considered to be richer and also it is not doing as badly as our stereotype of a large Hindi state might have been. See again one more graphic on Uttar Pradesh it tells you the ratio of capital outlay capital spending as a percentage of GDP, GSDP it is quite robust quite healthy at 4.1 at 4.1 it is almost twice as much as the national average of 2.3. What does this picture tell you when you look at all these heat maps and the state of fiscal health of India's major states it tells you that today this competitive distributive politics which means I will give you 2000, I will give you to 2500 free bus travel, free metro travel, free electricity, free water all of this is being done to buy boards and it is irresponsible. Well, fairism is not bad particularly in a poor country but when something is made so transactional and linked to boards it is actually not something that works for the voter because ultimately it is a competitive race to the bottom which is bankruptcy. So, there I can do no better than take you to something that Ronald Reagan once said he made a very strong case for responsible fiscal politics and he said when somebody says I will give you this free I will give you this free I will give you this free or this cheap or that cheap you must remember from where will that politician find the resources to do it that politician will the only resource that politician who is giving you the gababes has is your taxes. So, it is a bit like taking money out of your pocket spending some of it on himself and giving the rest back to you and for you to say thank you very much and he said the test to apply is offer somebody a hundred dollar note and say either you can have this hundred dollar note or I can give you these few freebies then a voter will figure out what is good for me because ultimately what is being given to you is what has come from you to the politician. Unfortunately, that is the kind of competitive populism we are seeing right now and that reflects in the fiscal health of our states."}
